				<p>Rashtrapati Bhavan, the grand presidential residence of India, stands as an iconic symbol of the country's rich history and architectural marvel. Constructed during the British Raj, the foundation stone of this majestic structure was laid on 12th February 1912 by the then Viceroy of India, Lord Hardinge. The inspiration behind its creation was to shift the capital from Calcutta to Delhi and design an imposing residence that befits the dignity of the British monarch's representative.</p>
				<p>The construction of Rashtrapati Bhavan is a remarkable blend of diverse architectural styles. The mastermind behind its design was the British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, along with Herbert Baker, who infused elements of Indian and Western architecture. The building boasts a fusion of classical and Mughal styles, incorporating domes, arches, and intricate carvings. The usage of sandstone quarried from Rajasthan and marble from Makrana, as well as other indigenous materials, showcases the craftsmanship of skilled Indian artisans.</p>
				<p>Beyond its architectural splendor, Rashtrapati Bhavan is steeped in symbolism, reflecting India's cultural heritage and democratic values. The sprawling Amrit Udyan, open to the public during spring, serve as a harmonious connection between the President and the citizens, fostering a sense of inclusivity and accessibility. The grand Durbar Hall, adorned with royal insignia, evokes a sense of regality, while the Ashoka Hall, with its iconic Ashoka Chakra, pays homage to India's ancient emblem of righteousness and virtue. </p>
				<p>Rashtrapati Bhavan stands as a testament to India's past, present, and future. With its blend of architectural splendor, historical significance, and symbolic representation, it serves as a visual ode to the nation's journey towards independence and its transformation into a vibrant democracy. This iconic edifice continues to inspire awe and reverence, leaving an indelible mark on the hearts of visitors from all corners of the globe.</p>
				<p>Quite a number of Rashtrapati Bhavan-related stamps were issued as shown above. Some of them are:<br />1. <b><i>British-era Issue: Inauguration of Delhi, 2As (Date of Release: Feruary 2, 1931.)</b></i><br />2. <b><i>Se-tenant: New Delhi Diamond Jubilee, ₹11.50 (Date of Release: June 25, 1991.)</b></i><br />3. <b><i>Miniature Sheet: Rashtrapati Bhavan, ₹20 (Date of Release: August 5, 2011.)</b></i><br />4. <b><i>Joint Issue: India-Singapore, ₹25 (Date of Release: November 24, 2015.)</b></i></p>

				<p>Deekshabhoomi is the site Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, father of Indian Constitution, embraced Buddhism on 14 October, 1956. After his death on 6 December 1956, Param Pooja Dr. Ambedkar Smarak Samiti, the governing body of the site, decided to build a Buddhist stupa on the premises.</p>
				<p>Construction of the stupa began in July 1978, designed by Nagpur-based architect Sheo Dan Mal. It is also the first Asian structure to implement the method of Central Block Locking System in constructing a hollow globe-like structure. The site covers 22 acres of land, and the stupa stands at a height of 120 feet. The main structure is supported by four expanding arrangements of 16 columns at the first, 16 columns at the second, 24 at the third, and the last layer of 24 columns again. The ground floor has a space of more than 20,000 sq. feet and is meant for offering prayer. It houses the mortal remains of Dr. Ambedkar.</p>
				<p>The stupa has four gates, similar in structuring of Sanchi Stupa, Madhya Pradesh. They are mounted with images of Dhammachakra, horses, elephants, and lions carved in Rajasthani marble. The space in between is decorated with green plantation and palm trees.</p>			
				<p>3 Bodhi trees are planted at eastern side of the stupa side by side. The saplings were brought from Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, after placing an official request with the latter. They were taken from the same Bodhi Tree planted by Sanghamitra, daughter of the Great Emperor Ashoka, during her monkhood (253 B. C.). The Tree from which the saplings were collected was a sapling of the Bodhivriksha under which Lord Buddha became enlightened.</p>

				<p>Vidhana Soudha, an iconic symbol of Bengaluru and the seat of the Karnataka state legislature, stands as a monumental testament to the fusion of traditional Dravidian and modern architectural styles. Its construction, envisioned to be a representation of the legislative sovereignty of the people, began in 1951 and was completed in 1956. This grand structure, often referred to as the "Taj Mahal of South India," was the brainchild of Kengal Hanumanthaiah, the then Chief Minister of Mysore State, now Karnataka. Hanumanthaiah was driven by the desire to create a building that would reflect the state's rich heritage and emerging status post-independence.</p>
				<p>The inception of Vidhana Soudha was marked by considerable debate and planning. The foundation stone was laid by Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, in 1951. The edifice was designed by a team of architects led by B.R. Manickam, who incorporated elements from various Dravidian temples of South India, blending them with modern sensibilities. This blend is evident in the building’s grand staircases, massive columns, and domes, which exhibit the intricacy of temple architecture while fulfilling the functional needs of a legislative building.</p>
				<p>Constructed primarily using granite, the building covers an area of over 60 acres and boasts a floor area of about 5,50,505 square feet. The structure is crowned by four domes, one at each corner, with the central dome housing the legislative chamber. The entrance, marked by a grand staircase, leads to the central hall which is flanked by two legislative houses - the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council. Each detail of the Vidhana Soudha, from the intricate woodwork in the interiors to the decorative motifs on the exteriors, reflects the craftsmanship and dedication of the workers and artisans involved.</p>
				<p>Kengal Hanumanthaiah faced numerous challenges during the construction of Vidhana Soudha, including financial constraints and political opposition. Yet, his unwavering vision and commitment saw the project to fruition, creating a building that not only serves its legislative purpose but also stands as a cultural landmark. The edifice, with its inscription "Government's Work is God's Work" in both English and Kannada, embodies the spirit of democracy and public service.</p>
				<p>Today, Vidhana Soudha is more than just a legislative building; it is a symbol of Karnataka’s political ethos and architectural grandeur. It attracts tourists and dignitaries alike, serving as a proud reminder of the state's rich history and progressive future. The legacy of those who envisioned and constructed Vidhana Soudha continues to inspire, making it a revered monument in the heart of Bengaluru.</p>

				<p>The High Court building of Karnataka, known as Attara Kacheri, is a majestic colonial structure located opposite the Vidhana Soudha in Bengaluru. This striking edifice, painted in vibrant red, stands as a prominent example of neoclassical architecture, embodying the grandeur and historical significance of Karnataka’s judicial system. The name "Attara Kacheri," which translates to "eighteen offices," is derived from the original plan of the building, which housed the secretariat of the State of Mysore.</p>
				<p>The construction of the High Court building began in 1864 and was completed in 1868, during the reign of Maharaja Chamarajendra Wadiyar X. The building was designed by Colonel Richard Hieram Sankey, an engineer with the British East India Company, who played a pivotal role in shaping Bengaluru’s colonial infrastructure. Sankey's vision for the High Court combined elements of Greco-Roman architecture with British colonial aesthetics, resulting in a building characterized by tall Corinthian columns, intricate cornices, and large, imposing windows.</p>
				<p>Attara Kacheri was originally built to serve as the office space for various government departments, and it later became the High Court of Karnataka. The building's design includes a central block flanked by two wings, creating a balanced and symmetrical appearance. The central block features a portico supported by eight imposing pillars, leading to a grand entrance that welcomes visitors into the heart of the judicial complex.</p>
				<p>The interiors of the High Court building are equally impressive, with high ceilings, spacious corridors, and intricately carved wooden furniture. The courtrooms are designed to provide an atmosphere of solemnity and authority, reflecting the building's role as the apex of justice in the state. The architecture not only serves its functional purpose but also conveys a sense of dignity and respect for the judicial process.</p>
				<p>Throughout its history, the High Court building has witnessed numerous significant legal battles and landmark judgments that have shaped the legal landscape of Karnataka and India. The building itself has undergone several renovations and expansions to accommodate the growing needs of the judiciary, yet it has retained its historical charm and architectural integrity.</p>
				<p>Today, the High Court of Karnataka stands as a symbol of justice and the rule of law. It continues to function as the central judicial authority in the state, with its premises bustling with legal professionals, litigants, and visitors. The building’s imposing presence, set against the backdrop of Bengaluru’s modern skyline, serves as a reminder of the state’s colonial past and its ongoing journey towards justice and governance.</p>
				<p>The High Court building of Karnataka, with its rich history and architectural splendor, remains a revered landmark in Bengaluru. It reflects the enduring legacy of those who envisioned and constructed it, and it continues to inspire awe and respect among all who encounter its grand facade.</p>

				<p>The Kempegowda Tower in Lalbagh, Bengaluru, is an enduring symbol of the city’s rich heritage and historical significance. Located within the sprawling 240-acre Lalbagh Botanical Garden, the tower stands atop a rocky hillock known as Peninsular Gneiss, one of the oldest rock formations in the world, dating back approximately 3,000 million years. The tower is one of four watchtowers erected by Kempegowda II, the son of Bengaluru’s founder Kempegowda I, to mark the boundaries of the city.</p>
				<p>Constructed in the 16th century, the Kempegowda Towers were part of an ambitious plan to delineate and protect the growing settlement of Bengaluru. Kempegowda II, a visionary leader, built these towers to provide a panoramic view of the city’s limits, ensuring that the city expanded within these boundaries. The Lalbagh tower, in particular, offers a stunning vista of Bengaluru’s urban expanse, juxtaposed against the natural beauty of Lalbagh’s lush greenery.</p>
				<p>The architectural style of the Kempegowda Tower reflects the simplicity and utilitarian design typical of the era. Made from stone, the tower features a small, conical structure with an observation platform at the top. Despite its modest design, the tower’s strategic placement on the elevated ground highlights its importance as a historical marker and a vantage point. Over the centuries, the tower has witnessed the transformation of Bengaluru from a small settlement to a bustling metropolis, serving as a silent sentinel over the city’s evolution. The other three towers are located at Mekhri Circle, Ulsoor Lake, and Kempambudhi Lake.</p>

				<p>The Ashoka Pillar in Jayanagar, Bengaluru, stands as a monumental symbol of post-independence India's spirit of nation-building and urban planning. This iconic structure, located in South Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore), marks the inauguration of Jayanagar, the country’s first and largest planned neighborhood. The project was spearheaded by the City Improvement Trust Board (CITB), an organization formed in 1945 to develop new residential extensions in old Bengaluru. On August 20, 1948, C. Rajagopalachari, popularly known as Rajaji and the first and last Indian Governor-General of India, inaugurated the Ashoka Pillar to mark the beginning of Jayanagar’s civil works.</p>
				<p>The construction of the Pillar was entrusted to P.S. Ranganathachar (PSR Char), a versatile engineer known for his dedication and efficiency. PSR Char was appointed by R. Madhavan, the Municipal Engineer of Bangalore City Corporation and later the Chief Engineer of CITB. The task had to be completed within a record time of ten days to align with Rajaji’s scheduled inauguration. Despite adverse weather conditions and the sudden disappearance of the main sculptor, PSR Char managed to complete the task with remarkable efficiency. A skilled mason named Arunachalam was brought in to finish the intricate work on the four-faced lion sculpture atop the pillar, working tirelessly through the night before the inauguration. The project, costing a total of Rs. 3000, was a testament to the commitment and resourcefulness of PSR Char and his team.</p>
				<p>The inauguration of the Ashoka Pillar was a grand event, attended by an enthusiastic audience and graced by Rajaji’s presence. Bengaluru historian Vemagal Somashekhar recalls how Rajaji laid the foundation stone using a special silver trowel (karne) with a wooden handle, symbolizing the commencement of the modern and well-planned layout of Jayanagar. The Ashoka Pillar stands approximately twenty feet tall, crowned with a sculpture of four lions akin to the National Emblem of India. It also bears the royal emblem of Mysore, the two-headed mythological bird Gandabherunda, signifying the region's cultural heritage.</p>
				<p>Spread over 1,500 acres, Jayanagar amalgamated Kanakanapalya and its surrounding villages, stretching from the Ashoka Pillar to Jayadeva Hospital. This planned neighborhood quickly became known for its well-structured layout and multicultural identity. The area from Ashoka Pillar to Madhavan Park was particularly notable for housing many VIPs of the time. While it is widely believed that Jayanagar was named after Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar, the last Maharaja of Mysore, there is no documented evidence to support this claim. Another theory suggests that the name Jayanagar, meaning "Victory Town" in Kannada, was chosen to commemorate India's victory as part of the British Empire in World War II. However, this too remains speculative.</p>
				<p>At the time of its construction, the Ashoka Pillar was surrounded by open fields and lacked the iron railings that are seen today. It marked the southern end of the city and was a prominent landmark of the emerging Jayanagar constituency. Over the decades, despite constant changes in traffic and urban development, the Ashoka Pillar has remained a steadfast symbol of Jayanagar's historical and cultural legacy. PSR Char’s son, PR Ramaswamy, recounts how his father continued photographing the construction process, capturing moments of this historic project. Today, the Ashoka Pillar endures as one of the few circles in Bengaluru that retains its original significance amidst the city’s rapid modernization.</p>

				<p>The Malabar Banded Peacock, scientifically known as Papilio buddha, is a strikingly beautiful butterfly native to the Western Ghats of India. This species is renowned for its vibrant coloration and distinct banded patterns on its wings, which display shades of iridescent blue and green. The Malabar Banded Peacock is an integral part of the rich biodiversity of the region and plays a crucial role in the ecosystem as a pollinator.</p>

				<p>Kumaravyasa, a name synonymous with the Kannada literary world, and the majestic Veeranarayana Temple in Gadag are inextricably linked. The 15th-century poet, renowned for his monumental translation of the Mahabharata into Kannada, found inspiration within the sacred precincts of this temple.</p>
				<p>Kumaravyasa's "Gadugina Bharata" is not merely a translation but a reimagining of the epic, imbued with the poet's unique style and deep understanding of Kannada literature. His poetic genius elevated the language, making it a vehicle for profound storytelling. Beyond his magnum opus, Kumaravyasa's literary contributions include "Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari," a shorter version of the Mahabharata, and "Prabhulingaleele," a work on the lives of the Vīraśaiva saints.</p>
				<p>The Veeranarayana Temple, a masterpiece of Hoysala architecture, was commissioned by King Vishnuvardhana around 1117 CE. Its intricate carvings, ornate pillars, and towering gopurams are a testament to the architectural brilliance of the era. The main deity, Veeranarayana (<i>lit</i>. "Brave Narayana"), a form of Vishnu, is a magnificent black stone idol, exuding a serene and powerful aura.</p>
				<p>The deity is depicted in a standing position, holding the attributes Conch (<i>shanka</i>), Wheel (<i>chakra</i>), Club (<i>gadha</i>) and Lotus (<i>padma</i>) in his four hands. The attire on deity (<i>dhoti</i>) is worn in a veera kaccha ("warrior style") giving the appearance of being "ready for battle". The deity is flanked by his consort Lakshmi and companion Garuda the eagle.. The temple complex, with its serene atmosphere and divine energy, provided the perfect backdrop for Kumaravyasa's creative genius. Legend has it that he composed his works while sitting beneath a specific pillar in the temple, receiving divine inspiration from the deity. The pillar is now called "Kumaravyasa Pillar."</p>
				<p>The association between Kumaravyasa and the Veeranarayana Temple is a testament to the enduring power of art, culture, and spirituality. The temple, with its rich history and architectural splendor, continues to inspire and awe visitors, while Kumaravyasa's literary legacy lives on, enriching the cultural heritage of Karnataka.</p>

				<p>The Parvati-Kumaraswamy Temple complex in Sandur, Karnataka, is a captivating historical site, housing two distinct temples: the Parvati Temple and the Kumaraswamy Temple. These structures, built centuries apart, stand side by side, each with its unique architectural style and religious significance.</p>
				<p>The Parvati Temple, constructed during the 7th or 8th century CE by the Badami Chalukyas, is an exquisite example of Dravidian architecture. Its simple yet elegant design features a sanctum, an antechamber, and a pillared hall. The temple's exterior is adorned with intricate carvings depicting various deities and mythological scenes. The interior houses a serene sanctum enshrining the deity Parvati.</p>
				<p>The Kumaraswamy Temple, built by the Rashtrakutas between the 8th and 10th centuries CE, is a more elaborate structure. It showcases a blend of Dravidian and Nagara architectural styles, evident in its tall tower (vimana) and ornate pillars. The temple is dedicated to Kartikeya, the Hindu god of war, also known as Murugan or Subramanya. Legend has it that this temple is the first abode of Kartikeya in South India.</p>
				<p>The juxtaposition of these two temples, built centuries apart, offers a fascinating glimpse into the evolution of Hindu temple architecture. The Parvati Temple, with its simpler design, represents the early phase of Dravidian architecture, while the Kumaraswamy Temple showcases the more elaborate and ornate style that developed later.</p>
				<p>The presence of both temples within the same complex can be attributed to the deep-rooted belief in the divine couple, Parvati and Shiva. Parvati, as the consort of Shiva, is often depicted alongside her husband. The construction of the Parvati Temple, likely a later addition to the existing Kumaraswamy complex, may have been motivated by a desire to honor the divine couple together.</p>

				<p>Sri Ramana Maharshi, born Venkataraman Iyer on December 30, 1879, in Tamil Nadu, India, is one of the most revered spiritual teachers of modern India. His teachings have had a profound influence on both Indian and Western seekers of truth. Ramana Maharshi's life was marked by simplicity, humility, and an unwavering pursuit of self-realization. He is best known for his teachings on self-inquiry, encapsulated in the question "Who am I?" which serves as a direct path to self-realization and the dissolution of the ego.</p>
				<p>At the age of sixteen, Venkataraman experienced a profound spiritual awakening. Overwhelmed by an intense fear of death, he spontaneously engaged in a process of self-inquiry, which led him to the realization that his true self was not his body, but an immortal consciousness beyond physical form. This experience transformed him entirely, and he lost interest in worldly affairs. In 1896, he left his home and traveled to the sacred mountain of Arunachala in Tiruvannamalai, where he remained for the rest of his life.</p>
				<p>Ramana Maharshi spent the early years of his time at Arunachala in silence, absorbed in deep meditation. His presence and silence attracted seekers from all over India, and gradually, a community of disciples formed around him. This led to the establishment of Ramanasramam, the ashram dedicated to his teachings and the spiritual practice of self-inquiry. The ashram, located at the foothills of Arunachala, has since become a significant spiritual center, drawing visitors from around the world.</p>
				<p>Ramanasramam is not just a place of residence but a sanctuary for spiritual seekers who come to immerse themselves in the teachings of Ramana Maharshi. The ashram's serene environment, coupled with the palpable spiritual energy of Arunachala, creates an atmosphere conducive to meditation and self-inquiry. Devotees engage in various activities, such as chanting, meditation, and studying Ramana's teachings, all aimed at deepening their understanding and realization of the self.</p>
				<p>The central teaching of Ramana Maharshi revolves around the practice of self-inquiry. He taught that by constantly asking the question "Who am I?" and turning attention inward, one could dissolve the ego and realize the true self, which is pure consciousness. This method bypasses intellectual reasoning and directly addresses the root of ignorance, leading to liberation. Ramana emphasized that self-realization is not a distant goal but the true nature of every individual, accessible here and now through persistent self-inquiry.</p>
				<p>Ramana Maharshi's influence extended beyond his physical presence. His teachings, compiled in numerous books and recordings, continue to inspire spiritual seekers globally. Notable works include "Who Am I?", "Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi," and "The Collected Works of Sri Ramana Maharshi." These texts capture the essence of his teachings and provide practical guidance for those on the spiritual path.</p>
				<p>Ramanasramam remains a vibrant center of spiritual practice and study. The ashram hosts regular events, such as satsangs (spiritual gatherings), lectures, and meditation sessions, fostering a sense of community among seekers. The presence of Arunachala, believed to be a manifestation of Lord Shiva, further enhances the spiritual ambiance of the ashram.</p>

				<p>The Shyamrai Temple in Bishnupur, West Bengal, stands as a splendid monument reflecting the rich heritage and artistic ingenuity of the Malla dynasty. Erected in 1643 AD by Malla king Raghunath Singha, the temple is dedicated to Lord Krishna, also revered as Shyamrai. Known as the Pancha Ratna Temple, it is celebrated for its distinctive architectural style and intricate terracotta carvings that vividly depict scenes from Hindu mythology and the lives of the people of that era.</p>
				<p>The Shyamrai Temple is distinguished by its five pinnacles, or ratnas, characteristic of the Pancha Ratna style of temple architecture. These pinnacles, arranged symmetrically, lend a striking profile to the temple, enhancing its visual appeal and signifying its religious importance. The square base is surmounted by a central pinnacle, flanked by four smaller ones at each corner, creating a balanced and harmonious structure.</p>
				<p>Constructed using laterite and bricks, the Shyamrai Temple exemplifies the use of terracotta in Bengal temple architecture. Laterite, a reddish clay-like material, was locally available and provided a sturdy foundation. Bricks, meticulously baked and intricately carved, were employed to craft the elaborate terracotta panels that adorn the temple walls. These terracotta tiles are the temple's most remarkable feature, showcasing the artisans' exceptional skill and creativity.</p>
				<p>The terracotta panels serve as a visual narrative, depicting various scenes from the life of Krishna, episodes from the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, and everyday activities of the people during the Malla period. The precision and detail in these carvings are astonishing, capturing divine battles, pastoral scenes, and daily life with lifelike quality. For instance, panels show Krishna playing the flute amidst gopis, the epic battle of Kurukshetra from the Mahabharata, and scenes of social and domestic life, providing valuable insights into the social, cultural, and religious milieu of the time.</p>
				<p>The construction of the Shyamrai Temple reflects an amalgamation of traditional Bengali architectural techniques with influences from other parts of India. The Pancha Ratna style signifies broader Indian architectural influence, while the extensive use of terracotta as a decorative medium is a distinctive feature of Bengali temple architecture. This blend of styles sets the Shyamrai Temple apart from its contemporaries in other regions.</p>
				<p>The temple’s layout and structural elements demonstrate advanced engineering skills. The raised platform base protects it from flooding, a common issue in Bengal’s riverine landscape. Thick walls provide stability and support to the heavy superstructure, while the simpler interiors facilitate easy movement of devotees and accommodate large gatherings during festivals and religious ceremonies.</p>
				<p>Beyond its architectural and historical significance, the Shyamrai Temple holds immense cultural and spiritual value. It continues to be a site of worship and pilgrimage, attracting visitors who come to admire its beauty and seek blessings. Despite facing natural and human-induced challenges over the centuries, the temple remains resilient, symbolizing the enduring legacy of the Malla dynasty and Bengal's rich heritage.</p>
				<p>A postage stamp worth ₹12 related to the temple was issued along with similar monuments under the series <b><i>Terracota Temples of India. (Date of Release: August 8, 2020)</i></b></p>

				<p>The Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves, Dhauli Hill and Stupa, and Lingaraj Temple are significant historical and cultural landmarks located in and around Bhubaneswar, Odisha. Each of these sites offers a unique glimpse into the region's rich heritage and religious history.</p>
				<p>The Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves are ancient rock-cut shelters situated on two adjacent hills. These caves date back to the 2nd century BCE and were primarily carved out during the reign of King Kharavela of the Mahameghavahana dynasty. Udayagiri, meaning "Sunrise Hill," has 18 caves, the most notable being the Hathi Gumpha (Elephant Cave) with inscriptions detailing King Kharavela's achievements. The Rani Gumpha (Queen's Cave) is the largest and most intricately decorated, featuring beautiful carvings and two levels of cells and verandas. Khandagiri, or "Broken Hill," comprises 15 caves, including the Ananta Gumpha with its serpent carvings and the Tatowa Gumpha (Parrot Cave) adorned with parrot carvings. These caves were used by Jain monks for meditation and living, and their inscriptions and sculptures provide valuable insights into ancient Jainism and the period's cultural practices.</p>
				<p>Dhauli Hill, located near Bhubaneswar, is historically significant due to its association with Emperor Ashoka and the Kalinga War fought in 261 BCE. The profound impact of this war led Ashoka to embrace Buddhism and advocate for non-violence. Atop Dhauli Hill stands the Shanti Stupa, or Peace Pagoda, constructed in 1972 by the Japan Buddha Sangha and the Kalinga Nippon Buddha Sangha in collaboration with the Odisha government. This white-domed structure symbolizes peace and features large statues of Buddha in various postures and intricate carvings depicting scenes from Buddha's life. The base of Dhauli Hill is home to Ashoka's rock edicts, inscribed in Brahmi script, which express his commitment to Dharma (moral law) and non-violence.</p>
				<p>The Lingaraj Temple, an architectural marvel in Bhubaneswar, is one of the oldest and most revered Hindu temples in Odisha. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the temple dates back to the 11th century and showcases the Kalinga style of architecture. The temple complex spans over 250,000 square feet and includes several smaller shrines and temples. The main sanctum houses the Swayambhu (self-manifested) Lingam, a sacred symbol of Lord Shiva. The towering spire of the Lingaraj Temple, standing at about 180 feet, is adorned with intricate carvings and sculptures depicting various deities, mythological scenes, and motifs.</p>
				<p>The Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves reflect the region's ancient Jain culture and the artistic achievements of the time. Dhauli Hill and its Shanti Stupa highlight the transformative journey of Emperor Ashoka and the spread of Buddhism. The Lingaraj Temple stands as a testament to the enduring devotion to Lord Shiva and the grandeur of Hindu temple architecture.</p>

				<p>Puri Jagannath Temple, located in the eastern Indian state of Odisha, stands as one of the most revered Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Jagannath, believed to be an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. The temple's architecture is an exemplary showcase of Kalinga style, characterized by its towering spire (shikhara), intricately carved stone motifs, and a vast courtyard.</p>
				<p>Constructed on a raised platform and surrounded by a high fortified wall, the temple complex includes several structures such as the main sanctum (Garbhagriha), assembly hall (Jagamohana), and a kitchen (Rosaghara) where daily offerings (Mahaprasad) are prepared for the deity. No matter what time of the day it is, no matter where the sun is shining through in the sky, the temple doesn't have a shadow. The Mahaprasad is prepared in the Rosaghara kitchen by thousands of priests and 7 earthen pots are placed one above the other and the food is cooked over firewood and the food in the topmost pot gets cooked first followed by the rest.</p>
				<p>Beyond its architectural grandeur, Puri Jagannath Temple is shrouded in mysteries and legends. One of the most intriguing aspects is the Banajaga Yatra, a ritualistic journey undertaken to find sacred neem trees from which the idols of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra will be carved anew every 12 or 19 years, a process known as Nabakalebara. The exact location of these trees is believed to be divinely revealed to the priests through dreams.</p>
				<p>Temple flag (dhwaja) consistently flutters in the opposite direction of the prevailing airflow. The flag at the top of the Jagannath Temple flutters in an opposite to the direction in which the wind blows. 1800 years old tradition, a priest climbs atop the Shikhara of the Jagannath Temple every day in order to change the flag. The temple is as tall as a 45 story building. No protective gears are used for the same and it is performed with bare hands. The temple's spire rises dramatically above the central shrine, topped with a unique wheel called <b>Nilachakra</b> made of an alloy of eight metals. The most amazing fact is that any viewer who views the chakra from a height at any point in Puri always sees that the chakra faces towards itself.</p>
				<p>The temple is also famous for its Rath Yatra, or the Chariot Festival, where the idols of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra are taken out of the temple in massive chariots and pulled by thousands of devotees. This annual event draws millions of pilgrims from all corners of the country and beyond, showcasing the vibrant religious fervor and cultural heritage of Odisha.</p>
				<p>Rituals at the temple are meticulously followed according to ancient traditions. Only Hindus are allowed entry into the temple, and specific rituals are performed daily by a select group of priests who belong to certain Brahmin families traditionally associated with the temple's administration. The Mahaprasad, offered to the deity first and then distributed to devotees, holds immense significance, with specific rules governing its preparation and distribution.</p>
				<p>Puri Jagannath Temple's cultural significance extends beyond religious boundaries, encompassing art, literature, and music, making it a symbol of Odisha's rich cultural heritage. The temple's management is governed by elaborate rules and regulations laid down centuries ago, ensuring its sanctity and continuity.</p>

				<p>The Kamakhya Temple, located in Guwahati, Assam, is one of the most revered and significant Hindu pilgrimage sites in India. It is dedicated to the goddess Kamakhya, who is considered a form of Shakti or Devi, the divine feminine power.</p>
				<p>The main temple complex is situated atop the Nilachal Hill, overlooking the city of Guwahati and the Brahmaputra River. It is built with a mix of red bricks and stones, giving it a rugged yet majestic appearance. The entire temple is surrounded by lush greenery and offers breathtaking views of the surrounding natural landscape.</p>
				<p>The Kamakhya Temple is a unique amalgamation of different styles and influences. The current structure of the temple dates back to the 17th century, although the site itself has a history that extends much further. The temple follows a distinctive hybrid style, incorporating elements of both Hindu and Islamic architectural traditions.</p>
				<p>The most prominent architectural feature of the Kamakhya Temple is its dome-like structure, known as the shikhara. The shikhara is octagonal in shape and rises to a height of approximately 50 feet. It is adorned with intricate sculptures and carvings depicting various deities and mythological figures. The dome is topped with a golden amalaka (a circular ornament) and a kalasha (a pot-like structure), symbolizing prosperity and auspiciousness.</p>
				<p>Inside the temple, there are several smaller shrines dedicated to different forms of the goddess Kamakhya, as well as other Hindu deities. The sanctum sanctorum houses the main deity, a natural rock formation representing the yoni (female genitalia), which is considered a symbol of the goddess' creative power. The temple is also known for its association with Tantric practices and rituals.</p>
				<p>Apart from its architectural significance, the Kamakhya Temple is renowned for the Ambubachi Mela, a major festival held annually in the month of June. During this time, the temple attracts a large number of devotees who come to seek the blessings of the goddess.</p>
