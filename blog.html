				<p>Rashtrapati Bhavan, the grand presidential residence of India, stands as an iconic symbol of the country's rich history and architectural marvel. Constructed during the British Raj, the foundation stone of this majestic structure was laid on 12th February 1912 by the then Viceroy of India, Lord Hardinge. The inspiration behind its creation was to shift the capital from Calcutta to Delhi and design an imposing residence that befits the dignity of the British monarch's representative.</p>
				<p>The construction of Rashtrapati Bhavan is a remarkable blend of diverse architectural styles. The mastermind behind its design was the British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, along with Herbert Baker, who infused elements of Indian and Western architecture. The building boasts a fusion of classical and Mughal styles, incorporating domes, arches, and intricate carvings. The usage of sandstone quarried from Rajasthan and marble from Makrana, as well as other indigenous materials, showcases the craftsmanship of skilled Indian artisans.</p>
				<p>Beyond its architectural splendor, Rashtrapati Bhavan is steeped in symbolism, reflecting India's cultural heritage and democratic values. The sprawling Amrit Udyan, open to the public during spring, serve as a harmonious connection between the President and the citizens, fostering a sense of inclusivity and accessibility. The grand Durbar Hall, adorned with royal insignia, evokes a sense of regality, while the Ashoka Hall, with its iconic Ashoka Chakra, pays homage to India's ancient emblem of righteousness and virtue. </p>
				<p>Rashtrapati Bhavan stands as a testament to India's past, present, and future. With its blend of architectural splendor, historical significance, and symbolic representation, it serves as a visual ode to the nation's journey towards independence and its transformation into a vibrant democracy. This iconic edifice continues to inspire awe and reverence, leaving an indelible mark on the hearts of visitors from all corners of the globe.</p>

				<p>Deekshabhoomi is the site Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, father of Indian Constitution, embraced Buddhism on 14 October, 1956. After his death on 6 December 1956, Param Pooja Dr. Ambedkar Smarak Samiti, the governing body of the site, decided to build a Buddhist supa on the premises.</p>
				<p>Construction of the stupa began in July 1978, designed by Nagpur-based architect Sheo Dan Mal. It is also the first Asian structure to implement the method of Central Block Locking System in constructing a hollow globe-like structure. The site covers 22 acres of land, and the stupa stands at a height of 120 feet. The main structure is supported by four expanding arrangements of 16 columns at the first, 16 columns at the second, 24 at the third, and the last layer of 24 columns again. The ground floor has a space of more than 20,000 sq. feet and is meant for offering prayer. It houses the mortal remains of Dr. Ambedkar.</p>
				<p>The stupa has four gates, similar in structuring of Sanchi Stupa, Madhya Pradesh. They are mounted with images of Dhammachakra, horses, elephants, and lions carved in Rajasthani marble. The space in between is decorated with green plantation and palm trees.</p>
				<p>3 Bodhi trees are planted at eastern side of the stupa side by side. The saplings were brought from Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, after placing an official request with the latter. They were taken from the same Bodhi Tree planted by Sanghamitra, daughter of the Great Emperor Ashoka, during her monkhood (253 B. C.). The Tree from which the saplings were collected was a sapling of the Bodhivriksha under which Lord Buddha became enlightened.</p>

				<p>The Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves, Dhauli Hill and Stupa, and Lingaraj Temple are significant historical and cultural landmarks located in and around Bhubaneswar, Odisha. Each of these sites offers a unique glimpse into the region's rich heritage and religious history.</p>
				<p>The Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves are ancient rock-cut shelters situated on two adjacent hills. These caves date back to the 2nd century BCE and were primarily carved out during the reign of King Kharavela of the Mahameghavahana dynasty. Udayagiri, meaning "Sunrise Hill," has 18 caves, the most notable being the Hathi Gumpha (Elephant Cave) with inscriptions detailing King Kharavela's achievements. The Rani Gumpha (Queen's Cave) is the largest and most intricately decorated, featuring beautiful carvings and two levels of cells and verandas. Khandagiri, or "Broken Hill," comprises 15 caves, including the Ananta Gumpha with its serpent carvings and the Tatowa Gumpha (Parrot Cave) adorned with parrot carvings. These caves were used by Jain monks for meditation and living, and their inscriptions and sculptures provide valuable insights into ancient Jainism and the period's cultural practices.</p>
				<p>Dhauli Hill, located near Bhubaneswar, is historically significant due to its association with Emperor Ashoka and the Kalinga War fought in 261 BCE. The profound impact of this war led Ashoka to embrace Buddhism and advocate for non-violence. Atop Dhauli Hill stands the Shanti Stupa, or Peace Pagoda, constructed in 1972 by the Japan Buddha Sangha and the Kalinga Nippon Buddha Sangha in collaboration with the Odisha government. This white-domed structure symbolizes peace and features large statues of Buddha in various postures and intricate carvings depicting scenes from Buddha's life. The base of Dhauli Hill is home to Ashoka's rock edicts, inscribed in Brahmi script, which express his commitment to Dharma (moral law) and non-violence.</p>
				<p>The Lingaraj Temple, an architectural marvel in Bhubaneswar, is one of the oldest and most revered Hindu temples in Odisha. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the temple dates back to the 11th century and showcases the Kalinga style of architecture. The temple complex spans over 250,000 square feet and includes several smaller shrines and temples. The main sanctum houses the Swayambhu (self-manifested) Lingam, a sacred symbol of Lord Shiva. The towering spire of the Lingaraj Temple, standing at about 180 feet, is adorned with intricate carvings and sculptures depicting various deities, mythological scenes, and motifs.</p>
				<p>The Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves reflect the region's ancient Jain culture and the artistic achievements of the time. Dhauli Hill and its Shanti Stupa highlight the transformative journey of Emperor Ashoka and the spread of Buddhism. The Lingaraj Temple stands as a testament to the enduring devotion to Lord Shiva and the grandeur of Hindu temple architecture.</p>

				<p>The Kamakhya Temple, located in Guwahati, Assam, is one of the most revered and significant Hindu pilgrimage sites in India. It is dedicated to the goddess Kamakhya, who is considered a form of Shakti or Devi, the divine feminine power.</p>
				<p>The main temple complex is situated atop the Nilachal Hill, overlooking the city of Guwahati and the Brahmaputra River. It is built with a mix of red bricks and stones, giving it a rugged yet majestic appearance. The entire temple is surrounded by lush greenery and offers breathtaking views of the surrounding natural landscape.</p>
				<p>The Kamakhya Temple is a unique amalgamation of different styles and influences. The current structure of the temple dates back to the 17th century, although the site itself has a history that extends much further. The temple follows a distinctive hybrid style, incorporating elements of both Hindu and Islamic architectural traditions.</p>
				<p>The most prominent architectural feature of the Kamakhya Temple is its dome-like structure, known as the shikhara. The shikhara is octagonal in shape and rises to a height of approximately 50 feet. It is adorned with intricate sculptures and carvings depicting various deities and mythological figures. The dome is topped with a golden amalaka (a circular ornament) and a kalasha (a pot-like structure), symbolizing prosperity and auspiciousness.</p>
				<p>Inside the temple, there are several smaller shrines dedicated to different forms of the goddess Kamakhya, as well as other Hindu deities. The sanctum sanctorum houses the main deity, a natural rock formation representing the yoni (female genitalia), which is considered a symbol of the goddess' creative power. The temple is also known for its association with Tantric practices and rituals.</p>
				<p>Apart from its architectural significance, the Kamakhya Temple is renowned for the Ambubachi Mela, a major festival held annually in the month of June. During this time, the temple attracts a large number of devotees who come to seek the blessings of the goddess.</p>
