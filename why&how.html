		<marquee><a href="Final Spl Cover Policy.pdf"> Please click here for more details on availability of Special Cancellations at Post Offices.</a></marquee>
	
		<p>The reason for collecting a cancellation is to create an awareness about the subject of the cancellation, and indicate that the item has been used and to prevent its reuse. As the item is issued by Dept. of Posts, stationary related to the same should be used.</p>
	
		<p>When you use a stamp to mail a letter, the stamp is cancelled to show that it has been used to pay for the postage. This helps to prevent the stamp from being used again, which would result in lost revenue for the postal service.</p>
	
		<p>Similarly, when you send a postcard or an inland letter card, the cancellation mark is used to show that the postage has been paid and to prevent the item from being used again. The cancellation mark also serves to indicate the date and location of mailing, which is useful for postal authorities to track the movement of mail and for historians to study postal history.</p>
	
		<p>In summary, the purpose of getting a cancellation on a stamp, postcard, postage cover, and inland letter card is to indicate that the postage has been paid and to prevent the item from being used again.</p>
	
		<p>In the case of Permanent Pictorial Cancellation, which takes up quite a lot of space in some instances, one must make sure to place it correctly. Here's how:</p>
	
		<ul class="details">
			<li><b>a. Postcard:</b> It must be placed on the right side of the card, and the cancellation should touch the stamp area (known as indicia), which is called a Tied Cancellation. It validates the postcard, preventing it from being used further (unless a stamp of the same value is added to it.) Note that getting a cancellation on both sides of the card is highly advisable because one can see the design quite clearly. Getting it on the blank side is inadvisable because it is not a proven authentic way, which is called an Untied Cancellation.</li>
			
			<p></p>
			
			<li><b>b. Inland Letter Card, Postage Cover, and Stamp:</b> The cancellation should touch the stamp area. Norms have been established according to the position of stamps on an envelope, so make sure to understand the rules before sticking stamps on the covers.</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>The same applies to Special Cancellations, but their validity lasts only for the same day. After the duration of the pre-printed date is over, the cancellation becomes invalid for traveling postally.</p>
		
		<p>To avoid spending money on any type of postal stationery more than their monetary and shipping charges <b>(unless they are rare)</b> from any individual or a business organisation, make sure to get in touch with updates from related philatelic groups and your philatelist frineds, who will help you out. Regular updates are always posted in such groups.</p>
