			<h1><b>HOW TO COLLECT</b></h1>
			<p>To collect a pictorial cancellation or a special cancellation, multiple ways are followed. Sending postal stationery to a post office which has a PPC, depending on an electronic money order (eMO), and collecting in person are the common practices.</p>

			<h3><b>Self Addressed Stamped Envelope (SASE)</b></h3>
			<p>Sending SASE is a common practice among philatelists who want to collect a PPC when they could not collect it in person. This method is most suitable for collecting PPCs. Various modes of postage (such as ordinary, registered, and speed post) are utilized for this purpose. </p>
			<p><b><u>Required Articles</u></b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>2 envelopes (according to your requirement)</li>
				<li>Postage stamps (all possible denominations)</li>
				<li>Postal stationery (self-designed articles, postcards, envelopes, and inland letter cards</li>
				<li>The usuals. (pen, glue, address stickers, etc...)</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b><u>Steps to Follow</u></b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Write <b>your address</b> as <b>"To Address"</b> on one envelope.</li>
				<li>Calculate the required postage at the post office based on the chosen mode of sending (e.g., Ordinary Post, Registered Post, Registered Parcel, or Speed Post).</li>
				<li>On the second envelope, write:</li>
				<ul>
					<li><b>To Address</b>: The location where you plan to obtain the PPC.</li>
					<li><b>From Address</b>: Your address.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Place the postal stationery and the prepared envelope (which will be used to send back the PPC) inside the <b>second envelope</b>.</li>
				<li>Seal the <b>second envelope</b> and post it to the <b>selected location</b>.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3><b>Electronic Money Order (eMO)</b></h3>
			<p>Sending eMO is one of the economical ways to collect a PPC or a Special Cancellation. While PPCs are available throughout the year, Special Cancellations are available only for a day (if traveled post is preferred), and they may not be available past the date of issue.</p>
			<p>However, this method may not be entirely reliable, as the post office may not have the necessary postal stationery that you might require. It may lead to delay in getting your requirements.</p>

			<h3><b>Collecting in Person</b></h3>
			<p>Collecting a PPC personally is always fun. If you are new to this hobby, the experience will be amazing. It will be a reminder of the journey you are having at that moment. On important days, there is a chance that you may get to meet people who collect these, which turns into friendships.</p>
			<p>In this era of social media, writing to friends the old-fashioned way makes us feel special. Also, it helps us de-stress and keep ourselves sane.</p>
