		<p>Kamal Basadi, also known as Kamal Basti, is a 13th-century Jain temple located within the historic Belgaum Fort in Belagavi, Karnataka. Constructed in 1204 CE by Birchiraja (also known as Jaya Raya), a minister in the court of Ratta dynasty ruler Kartavirya IV, the temple was built under the guidance of Jain monk Subhachandrabhattarakadeva. The temple's construction is attributed to architects Kartaviryadeva and Yuvrajakumara Mallikarjunadeva, as per inscriptions dating back to 1205 CE.</p>
		<p>The primary deity enshrined in Kamal Basadi is Lord Neminatha, the 22nd Tirthankara in Jainism. The black stone idol of Neminatha, believed to date back to the 11th century, predates the temple itself and was reportedly discovered in a forest. The temple also houses idols of other Tirthankaras, including Bhagwan Sumatinath in kayotsarga posture, Bhagwan Parshvanath under the shade of a seven-hooded serpent, and Bhagwan Adinath in padmasana posture. Additionally, a rare monolithic idol representing the Navagraha, depicted by nine Tirthankaras, is present within the sanctum.</p>
		<p>Architecturally, Kamal Basadi is a fine example of Western Chalukya style, with influences from Kadamba Nagara design evident in its stepped pyramidal shikhara. The temple's name, "Kamal," meaning lotus, is derived from the intricately carved lotus motif with 72 petals on the ceiling of the mukhamantapa (main hall). These petals symbolize the 24 Tirthankaras of the past, present, and future. The temple's interior features lathe-turned pillars with polished surfaces, perforated stone screens (jaalis), and carvings of the ashta-dikpalas (guardians of the eight directions) on the ceiling.</p>
		<p>The temple complex comprises three main sections: the mukhamantapa (entrance hall), antarala (vestibule), and garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum). The garbhagriha houses the main deity, while the antarala features lantern-shaped ceilings with lotus motifs and separates the sanctum from the main hall using intricately carved stone screens. The mukhamantapa is adorned with stone benches along its periphery and showcases the temple's signature lotus ceiling.</p>
		<p>Kamal Basadi is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India and continues to be a site of religious significance and architectural interest. The temple's historical importance is further highlighted by its proximity to the Chikki Basadi, another Jain temple within the Belgaum Fort complex, though now in ruins. The enduring legacy of Kamal Basadi reflects the rich Jain heritage and the architectural prowess of the period in which it was constructed.</p>
