		<p>Rajajinagar, a prominent locality in Bengaluru, holds historical and economic significance, with its roots tracing back to India's post-independence era. The foundation pillar of Rajajinagar was inaugurated on July 3, 1949, by Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar to mark the 70th birthday of C. Rajagopalachari, after whom the locality is named. Initially designed as a planned neighborhood, Rajajinagar was meant to balance industrial and residential development, fostering economic growth while providing quality living spaces.</p>
    <p>The locality was meticulously planned with distinct industrial and residential zones. Around 500 acres were dedicated to industries, attracting textile mills, machinery manufacturers, and chemical plants, which played a crucial role in Bengaluru’s industrial boom. The remaining land was divided into nearly 4,000 housing plots, allowing for the development of a self-sufficient residential community. The area's strategic layout led to an influx of workers and professionals, driving further urbanization.</p>
    <p>As Bengaluru grew into an IT and commercial powerhouse, Rajajinagar also evolved, embracing modern infrastructure and urban amenities. The locality is well-connected by major roads, including Dr. Rajkumar Road, linking it to key business districts like Malleshwaram and Yeshwanthpur. The Metro Green Line further enhanced connectivity, making Rajajinagar a preferred residential area for working professionals. Over the years, the expansion of shopping complexes, restaurants, and healthcare facilities has solidified its position as a prime residential and commercial hub.</p>
    <p>Today, Rajajinagar boasts several well-known landmarks that contribute to its distinct identity. The ISKCON Temple, a major spiritual and cultural center, attracts thousands of devotees and tourists. Brigade Gateway, home to the World Trade Center and Orion Mall, serves as a major commercial and entertainment destination. The presence of ESI Hospital, along with prestigious educational institutions, has strengthened the locality’s healthcare and academic landscape. Additionally, the area is dotted with parks, local markets, and cultural centers, making it a vibrant and well-rounded neighborhood.</p>
    <p>With its rich history, well-planned development, and modern infrastructure, Rajajinagar remains one of Bengaluru’s most sought-after localities. The blend of industrial heritage, commercial growth, and residential appeal makes it a thriving urban space that continues to shape the city's evolving landscape.</p>
