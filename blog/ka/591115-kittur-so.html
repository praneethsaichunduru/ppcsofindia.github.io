		<p>Kittur Rani Chennamma, born on October 23, 1778, in the small village of Kakati in present-day Karnataka, emerged as a pioneering figure in India's resistance against British colonial rule. From a young age, she received training in horse riding, sword fighting, and archery, skills that would later define her legacy. At the age of 15, she married Raja Mallasarja Desai, the ruler of Kittur, a princely state in Karnataka. Their union was marked by mutual respect and shared responsibilities in governance. Tragically, in 1816, her husband passed away, leaving her to navigate the complexities of leadership. The subsequent death of her only son in 1824 further deepened her challenges, compelling her to adopt Shivalingappa as her heir to ensure the continuity of Kittur's lineage.</p>
		<p>The British East India Company, under the Doctrine of Lapse, refused to recognize her adopted son's legitimacy. This doctrine allowed the British to annex any princely state lacking a natural male heir, a policy that threatened the sovereignty of many Indian kingdoms. In response, Rani Chennamma sent numerous letters to Lieutenant-Governor Mountstuart Elphinstone of the Bombay Presidency, pleading her case and seeking recognition for her adopted son. Her appeals, however, were met with indifference, and the British initiated military actions to annex Kittur.</p>
		<p>In October 1824, British forces, numbering over 20,000 men, attacked Kittur with the intent to confiscate its treasures and assert their dominance. Demonstrating exceptional leadership and valor, Rani Chennamma led her forces in a fierce defense of her kingdom. The initial confrontation resulted in a significant victory for Kittur: the British Collector and political agent, St John Thackeray, was killed, and two British officers, Mr. Stevenson and Sir Walter Elliot, were taken prisoner. Displaying magnanimity, Rani Chennamma released the captives in exchange for a cessation of hostilities. However, the British reneged on their promise, regrouped, and launched a second assault on Kittur.</p>
		<p>The subsequent battles were arduous. Despite her strategic acumen and the unwavering support of her lieutenant, Sangolli Rayanna, Rani Chennamma faced insurmountable odds. Betrayal from within her ranks further compromised Kittur's defenses; some insiders allegedly mixed cow dung with the gunpowder, rendering the kingdom's artillery ineffective. After a prolonged struggle, Rani Chennamma was captured and imprisoned in the Bailhongal Fort. There, she spent her remaining years, engaging in spiritual practices and reading holy texts, until her death on February 21, 1829.</p>
		<p>Rani Chennamma's legacy as one of India's earliest female freedom fighters is profound. Her defiance against colonial rule has been immortalized in Karnataka's cultural memory. Annual celebrations, such as the Kittur Utsava held from October 22 to 24, commemorate her bravery. In recognition of her contributions, a statue of Rani Chennamma was unveiled in the Indian Parliament Complex on September 11, 2007, by then-President Pratibha Patil. Additionally, her life has inspired various artistic endeavors, including a historical drama film directed by B. R. Panthulu. Her story continues to inspire generations, symbolizing resistance, courage, and the enduring fight for justice.</p>
