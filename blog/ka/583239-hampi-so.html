		<p>Hampi, located in the Indian state of Karnataka, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for its rich historical legacy and spectacular ruins. Situated on the banks of the Tungabhadra River, Hampi was once the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire, one of the largest and most powerful Hindu empires in South India during the 14th to 16th centuries. The city thrived as a bustling center of trade, religion, and culture. Its strategic location amidst rocky terrain served as a natural defense, making it an ideal site for a fortified capital. Accounts by Persian and Portuguese travelers described Hampi as a wealthy and grand city, second only to Rome in terms of splendor.</p>
		<p>The architecture of Hampi is a blend of Dravidian and Indo-Islamic styles, characterized by massive boulders, intricate carvings, and complex layouts. The city is spread over 4,100 hectares and contains more than 1,600 surviving structures, including palaces, temples, shrines, baths, and market streets. What distinguishes Hampi’s architecture is the seamless integration of the rocky landscape with man-made structures. Buildings were often carved directly into granite hills or made from locally available stone. The use of corbelled arches, stepped wells, pillared mandapas (pavilions), and gopurams (temple towers) reflect the sophisticated engineering and artistic expertise of the Vijayanagara artisans.</p>
		<p>Temples form the spiritual and architectural heart of Hampi. Among the most revered is the Virupaksha Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, which continues to be an active place of worship today. This temple predates the Vijayanagara Empire but was significantly expanded during their reign. It features a towering gopuram over 50 meters high, a pillared hall, sanctum sanctorum, and intricately carved ceilings. Another notable temple is the Vittala Temple, dedicated to an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. It is famous for its musical pillars—stone columns that emit musical notes when tapped. These temples not only served religious functions but also acted as social and cultural hubs for the community.</p>
		<p>Historically, Hampi reached its zenith under rulers like Krishnadevaraya, whose reign (1509–1529 CE) is considered a golden era for the empire. During this time, the city saw immense growth in architecture, literature, trade, and arts. Merchants from Arabia, Portugal, and even far-flung parts of Asia traded horses, spices, and precious stones in Hampi's bazaars. However, the city’s grandeur was abruptly halted in 1565 after the Battle of Talikota, when a coalition of Deccan Sultanates defeated Vijayanagara forces. The victorious armies ransacked and razed Hampi, leading to its gradual decline and abandonment.</p>
		<p>One of the most iconic monuments of Hampi is the Stone Chariot located within the Vittala Temple complex. This structure is not an actual chariot but a shrine built in the form of a chariot dedicated to Garuda, the vehicle of Lord Vishnu. Constructed from granite, it features elaborately carved wheels that appear movable, though they are fixed. The chariot rests on a richly sculpted base with detailed friezes depicting warriors, mythical creatures, and floral motifs. The Stone Chariot has become a symbol of Hampi and is often compared to the Sun Temple’s chariot at Konark. Its exceptional craftsmanship showcases the pinnacle of Vijayanagara artistry and continues to attract admiration from scholars and tourists alike.</p>
