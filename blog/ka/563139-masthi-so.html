		<p><strong>Masti Venkatesha Iyengar</strong> (<time datetime="1891-06-06">6 June 1891</time> – <time datetime="1986-06-06">6 June 1986</time>) was a towering figure in modern Kannada literature and one of the pioneers of the Navodaya movement. Born in <span title="Kolar district, Karnataka">Honganuru</span> near Malur in the Kolar district of the erstwhile Mysore State, he completed his education in Bangalore and went on to receive an M.A. in English Literature from the University of Madras. He later joined the Indian Civil Services, where he served in administrative positions across Karnataka. His administrative experience and deep understanding of human nature informed much of his later literary work.</p>
		<p>Iyengar began writing at an early age, but his major contributions to literature came after his retirement from civil service. Known popularly as <em>“Srinivasa”</em>, his pen name, Masti’s most significant work was in short stories. He wrote over 1200 short stories in Kannada, a feat that earned him the title <q>Kannada’s Boccaccio</q>. His stories often explored psychological depth and moral dilemmas, written in simple yet elegant prose. His most celebrated novel, <cite>Chikavira Rajendra</cite>, won the <abbr title="Jnanpith Award">Jnanpith</abbr> in 1983, marking him as the first Kannada writer to receive this highest literary honor in India.</p>
		<p>Masti’s literary universe was shaped by both Indian tradition and Western literary ideals. His characters were often drawn from rural life and historical settings, reflecting his keen observation of society. Alongside fiction, he also wrote plays, essays, biographies, and poems. He edited the monthly journal <i>Jivana</i> from 1944 to 1965, which became a platform for emerging writers. His biography of Muddu Krishna was particularly well-received, showcasing his skill in blending historical research with literary flair.</p>
		<p>Masti was a strong advocate of linguistic and cultural pride. Despite being fluent in English and well-read in Western classics, he chose to write almost entirely in Kannada. He played a central role in popularizing the language as a medium of serious literature. His works encouraged generations of writers to embrace Kannada and use it to explore universal themes. He was honored with several awards including the Padma Bhushan in 1954 for his contributions to literature and education.</p>
		<p>Beyond his literary and administrative work, Masti led a disciplined, scholarly life, deeply rooted in ethics and Gandhian simplicity. He remained active in literary circles well into his 90s. Even after achieving national recognition, he remained humble and committed to Kannada literature until his last day. His legacy continues through various literary forums, and the <abbr title="Karnataka Government">State Government</abbr> honors his memory with the “Masti Award,” given annually to outstanding Kannada writers.</p>
