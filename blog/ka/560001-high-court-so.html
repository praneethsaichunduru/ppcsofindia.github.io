		<p>The High Court building of Karnataka, known as Attara Kacheri, is a majestic colonial structure located opposite the Vidhana Soudha in Bengaluru. This striking edifice, painted in vibrant red, stands as a prominent example of neoclassical architecture, embodying the grandeur and historical significance of Karnataka’s judicial system. The name "Attara Kacheri," which translates to "eighteen offices," is derived from the original plan of the building, which housed the secretariat of the State of Mysore.</p>
		<p>The construction of the High Court building began in 1864 and was completed in 1868, during the reign of Maharaja Chamarajendra Wadiyar X. The building was designed by Colonel Richard Hieram Sankey, an engineer with the British East India Company, who played a pivotal role in shaping Bengaluru’s colonial infrastructure. Sankey's vision for the High Court combined elements of Greco-Roman architecture with British colonial aesthetics, resulting in a building characterized by tall Corinthian columns, intricate cornices, and large, imposing windows.</p>
		<p>Attara Kacheri was originally built to serve as the office space for various government departments, and it later became the High Court of Karnataka. The building's design includes a central block flanked by two wings, creating a balanced and symmetrical appearance. The central block features a portico supported by eight imposing pillars, leading to a grand entrance that welcomes visitors into the heart of the judicial complex.</p>
		<p>The interiors of the High Court building are equally impressive, with high ceilings, spacious corridors, and intricately carved wooden furniture. The courtrooms are designed to provide an atmosphere of solemnity and authority, reflecting the building's role as the apex of justice in the state. The architecture not only serves its functional purpose but also conveys a sense of dignity and respect for the judicial process.</p>
		<p>Throughout its history, the High Court building has witnessed numerous significant legal battles and landmark judgments that have shaped the legal landscape of Karnataka and India. The building itself has undergone several renovations and expansions to accommodate the growing needs of the judiciary, yet it has retained its historical charm and architectural integrity.</p>
		<p>Today, the High Court of Karnataka stands as a symbol of justice and the rule of law. It continues to function as the central judicial authority in the state, with its premises bustling with legal professionals, litigants, and visitors. The building’s imposing presence, set against the backdrop of Bengaluru’s modern skyline, serves as a reminder of the state’s colonial past and its ongoing journey towards justice and governance.</p>
		<p>The High Court building of Karnataka, with its rich history and architectural splendor, remains a revered landmark in Bengaluru. It reflects the enduring legacy of those who envisioned and constructed it, and it continues to inspire awe and respect among all who encounter its grand facade.</p>
