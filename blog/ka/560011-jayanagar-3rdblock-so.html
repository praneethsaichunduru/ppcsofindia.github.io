		<p>The Ashoka Pillar in Jayanagar, Bengaluru, stands as a monumental symbol of post-independence India's spirit of nation-building and urban planning. This iconic structure, located in South Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore), marks the inauguration of Jayanagar, the country’s first and largest planned neighborhood. The project was spearheaded by the City Improvement Trust Board (CITB), an organization formed in 1945 to develop new residential extensions in old Bengaluru. On August 20, 1948, C. Rajagopalachari, popularly known as Rajaji and the first and last Indian Governor-General of India, inaugurated the Ashoka Pillar to mark the beginning of Jayanagar’s civil works.</p>
		<p>The construction of the Pillar was entrusted to P.S. Ranganathachar (PSR Char), a versatile engineer known for his dedication and efficiency. PSR Char was appointed by R. Madhavan, the Municipal Engineer of Bangalore City Corporation and later the Chief Engineer of CITB. The task had to be completed within a record time of ten days to align with Rajaji’s scheduled inauguration. Despite adverse weather conditions and the sudden disappearance of the main sculptor, PSR Char managed to complete the task with remarkable efficiency. A skilled mason named Arunachalam was brought in to finish the intricate work on the four-faced lion sculpture atop the pillar, working tirelessly through the night before the inauguration. The project, costing a total of Rs. 3000, was a testament to the commitment and resourcefulness of PSR Char and his team.</p>
		<p>The inauguration of the Ashoka Pillar was a grand event, attended by an enthusiastic audience and graced by Rajaji’s presence. Bengaluru historian Vemagal Somashekhar recalls how Rajaji laid the foundation stone using a special silver trowel (karne) with a wooden handle, symbolizing the commencement of the modern and well-planned layout of Jayanagar. The Ashoka Pillar stands approximately twenty feet tall, crowned with a sculpture of four lions akin to the National Emblem of India. It also bears the royal emblem of Mysore, the two-headed mythological bird Gandabherunda, signifying the region's cultural heritage.</p>
		<p>Spread over 1,500 acres, Jayanagar amalgamated Kanakanapalya and its surrounding villages, stretching from the Ashoka Pillar to Jayadeva Hospital. This planned neighborhood quickly became known for its well-structured layout and multicultural identity. The area from Ashoka Pillar to Madhavan Park was particularly notable for housing many VIPs of the time. While it is widely believed that Jayanagar was named after Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar, the last Maharaja of Mysore, there is no documented evidence to support this claim. Another theory suggests that the name Jayanagar, meaning "Victory Town" in Kannada, was chosen to commemorate India's victory as part of the British Empire in World War II. However, this too remains speculative.</p>
		<p>At the time of its construction, the Ashoka Pillar was surrounded by open fields and lacked the iron railings that are seen today. It marked the southern end of the city and was a prominent landmark of the emerging Jayanagar constituency. Over the decades, despite constant changes in traffic and urban development, the Ashoka Pillar has remained a steadfast symbol of Jayanagar's historical and cultural legacy. PSR Char’s son, PR Ramaswamy, recounts how his father continued photographing the construction process, capturing moments of this historic project. Today, the Ashoka Pillar endures as one of the few circles in Bengaluru that retains its original significance amidst the city’s rapid modernization.</p>
