		<p>The Indian bison, or gaur (Bos gaurus), is the largest extant bovine species, native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Adult males can reach up to 2.2 meters at the shoulder and weigh between 1,000 to 1,500 kilograms. They possess a robust build, with a prominent dorsal ridge and a distinctive hump over the shoulders. Their dark brown to blackish coat contrasts with lighter-colored lower legs, giving the appearance of wearing stockings. Both sexes have curved horns, though those of males are more pronounced. Gaurs are primarily herbivorous, feeding on grasses, leaves, and fruits, and are known for their shy yet formidable nature.</p>
		<p>Globally, the gaur is classified as "Vulnerable" on the IUCN Red List, with an estimated population ranging from 13,000 to 30,000 individuals. India harbors approximately 85% of this population, making it a critical region for the species' conservation. Major populations are found in the Western Ghats, central India, and northeastern states. Conservation efforts, including habitat protection and anti-poaching measures, are vital for maintaining and increasing their numbers.</p>
		<p>Barnawapara Wildlife Sanctuary, located in Chhattisgarh's Mahasamund district, spans approximately 245 square kilometers. Established in 1976, the sanctuary features a mix of flat and hilly terrains, interspersed with rivers like the Jonk and Balamdehi, which provide essential water sources for wildlife. The sanctuary's diverse flora and fauna create an ideal habitat for the gaur, supporting their foraging and breeding activities.</p>
		<p>Within Barnawapara, gaurs are among the prominent megafauna, often observed in herds grazing in open meadows or resting in forested areas. Their presence indicates a healthy ecosystem, as they require extensive territories with abundant food and water. The sanctuary's management practices, including habitat preservation and monitoring, contribute to sustaining the gaur population.</p>
		<p>The gaur's role in Barnawapara extends beyond ecological significance; they are a key attraction for eco-tourism, drawing wildlife enthusiasts and researchers alike. Their grazing patterns aid in maintaining grassland health, which benefits other herbivores and predators. Continued conservation efforts in Barnawapara not only support the gaur but also enhance biodiversity and ecological balance in the region. </p>
