		<p>The Gondwana Marine Fossil Park, located in Manendragarh within the Koriya district of Chhattisgarh, stands as a testament to Earth's ancient marine history. Recognized as Asia's largest marine fossil site, the park offers invaluable insights into marine life that existed approximately 280 to 293 million years ago during the Permian period. The site is situated along the banks of the Hasdeo River, where sedimentary rock formations have preserved a rich array of marine fossils, including bivalve mollusks like Eurydesma and Aviculopecten, as well as bryozoans and crinoids.</p>
		<p>The discovery of these fossils dates back to 1954 when geologist S.K. Ghosh identified them during coal mining operations. Subsequent studies by the Geological Survey of India led to the area's designation as a National Geological Monument in 1982. Further research by the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences in Lucknow confirmed the site's significance, highlighting its potential as a center for education and geotourism.</p>
		<p>In recent years, the Chhattisgarh government has initiated efforts to develop the site into a comprehensive Marine Fossil Park. Plans include the establishment of a Jurassic Rock Garden, interpretive trails, and educational facilities to enhance visitor engagement and understanding of the region's paleontological importance. The park aims to serve as a hub for scientific research, education, and tourism, attracting geologists, students, and nature enthusiasts alike.</p>
		<p>The fossil record at Manendragarh provides critical evidence of the marine ecosystems that once thrived in the area, offering a window into the biodiversity and environmental conditions of the ancient Tethys Sea. The presence of diverse marine organisms in the fossil assemblage underscores the ecological richness of the period and contributes to our understanding of evolutionary processes and past climate change. </p>
		<p>Beyond its scientific value, the Gondwana Marine Fossil Park holds cultural and educational significance. By transforming the site into a geotourism destination, the initiative seeks to promote awareness of Earth's geological heritage and foster a sense of stewardship for natural history. The park's development aligns with broader efforts to integrate conservation, education, and sustainable tourism, positioning Chhattisgarh as a key player in the preservation and interpretation of ancient marine ecosystems.</p>
