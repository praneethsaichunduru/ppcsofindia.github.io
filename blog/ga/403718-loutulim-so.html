		<p>In the lush green setting of Loutolim, South Goa, the Big Foot Museum—also known as Ancestral Goa—hosts India’s most impressive laterite monument: a sprawling sculptural representation of Sant Mirabai carved from a single stone slab. This engineering and artistic marvel, titled “Natural Harmony,” extends roughly 14 metres in length and spans about 5 metres in width, earning it a place in the Limca Book of Records and the India Book of Records.</p>
		<p>The sculpture was the brainchild of local artist and conservationist Maendra Jocelino Araujo Alvares, founder, owner and curator of the Big Foot Museum. Driven by a passion to offer tourists more than just beaches and churches, he embarked on this ambitious project in August 1994. With only specially forged carving tools and sheer determination, he completed the entire work in just 30 days, enduring grueling labour that left the imprint of callouses on his hands.</p>
		<p>Mirabai was carefully chosen as the subject due to her legendary devotion to Lord Krishna and her status as a symbol of spiritual humility. Alvares envisioned a creation that would not only draw visitors but also inspire them spiritually. Carved from laterite—a common rock found across Goa—the sculpture incorporates deep symbolism through natural motifs. The tambura she plays bears emblems of a lotus and the sun, signifying growth amidst adversity and the nurturing power of nature.</p>
		<p>Although geologically defined by its single-slab medium, the sculpture is artistically rich. Its aesthetic is influenced by the Gandhara school, visible in Mirabai’s greco-roman drapery, while local Goan cultural signatures adorn her form: the kumkum on her forehead, armlets, pattli on her wrists, paisona anklets, and the distinctive fullam (golden floral head ornament) traditionally worn by Goan Hindu women.</p>
		<p>The Big Foot Museum itself sprawls across nine acres and immerses visitors in a reconstructed Goan village. Alongside the Mirabai sculpture stand displays of salt pans, cashew feni distillation, traditional fishermen’s huts, pottery workshops, and rural home dioramas. An imprint known as the “Big Foot”—a large footprint in stone—serves as a wishing spot meant for invoking blessings. The entire venue showcases local flora and fauna, including birdlife and butterflies, inviting viewers to connect with Goa’s ancestral heritage.</p>
		<p>Since opening to the public in April 1995, the sculpture has drawn over 30 million visitors—locals and tourists alike—attracted by its scale, spiritual aura, and demonstration of craftsmanship. Its monolithic form against a backdrop of jungle and village life fulfills Alvares’s mission: to elevate the often-overlooked hinterland of Goa into a cultural landmark, preserving rural traditions and celebrating art born of both land and faith.</p>
