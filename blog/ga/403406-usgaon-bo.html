		<p>Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary is located near the village of Usgaon in Ponda Taluka, Goa. It was officially established in 1969 and covers an area of 7.98 square kilometers, making it the smallest of Goa’s six wildlife sanctuaries. Despite its limited size, Bondla plays an important role in wildlife conservation, education, and rehabilitation. It is administered by the Goa Forest Department and serves as a popular destination for school excursions, researchers, and nature enthusiasts interested in observing the region’s flora and fauna in a protected environment.</p>
		<p>The sanctuary lies in the foothills of the Western Ghats and features a typical moist deciduous forest, with patches of semi-evergreen vegetation. Trees commonly found here include <i>Terminalia crenulata</i> (Matti), rosewood, teak, and bamboo species. The presence of perennial streams supports a dense understory of shrubs and climbers. These natural habitat conditions provide shelter and foraging grounds for various animal species, helping to sustain biodiversity within the sanctuary’s boundaries. The terrain is mostly gentle, with small hills and valleys that contribute to a diverse ecosystem.</p>
		<p>Bondla also functions as a rescue and rehabilitation center. It provides care for animals that are injured, displaced, or rescued from illegal captivity. Some of the animals at the facility include leopards, sloth bears, and snakes, including rescued king cobras. A mini-zoo within the sanctuary houses species such as the Indian bison (gaur), deer, jackals, and jungle cats. While this zoo is not extensive, it is used primarily for educational purposes and basic conservation awareness, especially for children and students visiting the sanctuary.</p>
		<p>The wildlife that inhabits Bondla includes sambar deer, wild boar, porcupines, and Malabar giant squirrels. Although sightings of larger predators are rare, leopards and jungle cats are occasionally observed. The sanctuary is also home to a variety of birds, with over 200 species recorded, including hornbills, parakeets, drongos, and bulbuls. Reptiles such as monitor lizards, rock pythons, and different types of frogs and toads can be found, especially during the monsoon season. Bondla is not known for large-scale biodiversity but serves as a representative habitat for Goa’s forest ecosystems.</p>
		<p>In addition to wildlife protection, Bondla promotes environmental education. It features a small Nature Interpretation Centre, a botanical garden, and a deer safari area. Facilities for visitors include forest cottages and dormitories maintained by the Forest Department, a small canteen, and walking trails. The sanctuary is open to the public from Tuesday to Sunday, while it remains closed on Mondays or for periodic maintenance. In recent years, it has hosted birdwatching events and nature camps to promote interest in conservation. The mini-zoo was temporarily closed in early 2025 for renovation and was reopened in June of the same year.</p>
