		<p>Reis Magos Fort is a historic coastal fortification located in the village of Reis Magos in North Goa, India, on the northern bank of the Mandovi River. Situated opposite the state capital Panaji, the fort was strategically built to guard the river’s entry point and to provide an advantageous view of the surrounding areas. It stands on a hill, offering panoramic views of the Mandovi estuary and Arabian Sea. The fort is named after the Three Wise Men (Reis Magos in Portuguese), and a nearby church dedicated to them adds religious and cultural significance to the area.</p>
		<p>The original structure on the site dates back to 1493 when it was built by Adil Shah of Bijapur as a military outpost. However, the fort as it stands today was reconstructed and significantly expanded by the Portuguese in 1551 after they took over the region. It was one of the first major forts the Portuguese constructed in Goa, making it among the oldest forts in the state. The Portuguese used it to secure their maritime routes and defend Old Goa, which was then their capital. Over time, it gained importance as both a military bastion and a governor’s residence.</p>
		<p>During the 17th century, Reis Magos Fort underwent several improvements. Cannon platforms were installed, and the fortifications were strengthened to withstand naval threats, particularly from the Dutch and the Marathas. In the 18th century, its role shifted from a defensive fort to a prison, and it served this function well into the 20th century. The fort was largely abandoned after 1993 when the last jail inmates were relocated, and its structures began to deteriorate from neglect and environmental exposure.</p>
		<p>Architecturally, Reis Magos Fort displays a blend of Portuguese military design and local Goan craftsmanship. Built using laterite stone—a material abundantly available in the region—the fort features high walls, cylindrical watchtowers with distinctive conical tiled roofs, and narrow passages typical of 16th-century coastal forts. It includes barracks, gun loops, and bastions. A water supply system and underground passages reflect the advanced planning used in its construction. The fort is closely associated with the Reis Magos Church, constructed in 1555, located at the base of the hill.</p>
		<p>After decades of neglect, restoration efforts began in 2008 under the joint stewardship of the Goa Government, the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), and the Helen Hamlyn Trust. The fort reopened to the public in 2012 as a cultural and heritage center. Today, Reis Magos Fort serves as a museum and event space, housing exhibitions on Goan history, fort architecture, and the works of noted cartoonist Mario Miranda. Its location and preservation make it a significant tourist attraction and an example of successful heritage conservation. Managed by the Goa Tourism Department and INTACH, it also functions as an educational site for students of architecture and history.</p>
