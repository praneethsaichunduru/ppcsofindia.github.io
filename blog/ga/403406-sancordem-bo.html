		<p>The Tambdi Surla Temple, located in the Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary near the village of Tambdi Surla in Sancordem, Goa, is the oldest surviving Hindu temple in the state. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, this 12th-century temple is a fine example of Kadamba-Yadava architecture, constructed from basalt stone brought from the Deccan plateau. Surrounded by dense forests at the foothills of the Western Ghats, the temple remains relatively secluded, adding to its spiritual aura and architectural appeal.</p>
		<p>The temple was built during the rule of the Kadamba dynasty, specifically under King Jayakeshi I around 1271 CE. The Kadambas were known for their patronage of Hindu temples, and Tambdi Surla stands as a rare monument from that era in Goa. The shrine is dedicated to Lord Shiva, depicted in the form of a linga, and is housed in a simple yet intricately carved sanctum (garbhagriha). The temple's design reflects Hemadpanthi style—characterized by precision stonework without the use of mortar—and features lotus motifs, figures of Hindu deities, and scenes from sacred texts carved into its black basalt walls.</p>
		<p>Unlike many other temples in Goa that were destroyed during the Portuguese colonization, Tambdi Surla escaped demolition, likely due to its remote forested location. While other major Hindu shrines in coastal areas were razed or repurposed, Tambdi Surla’s inaccessibility and distance from major colonial centers helped preserve its structure and sanctity. Oral traditions suggest that even during times of foreign rule, locals continued to secretly worship here, maintaining the temple’s rituals and cultural significance through centuries of upheaval.</p>
		<p>The temple complex consists of a small mandapa (pillared hall), antarala (vestibule), and garbhagriha, with a finely carved Nandi bull seated outside. The mandapa's ceiling features intricate floral patterns, while the pillars are adorned with miniature representations of gods and motifs from the Ramayana and Mahabharata. Unlike larger temples with ornate towers, Tambdi Surla has a modest shikhara (tower) over the sanctum, which, though partially damaged, remains a hallmark of its original style. A perennial stream flows near the temple, adding to the serene environment and enhancing its spiritual character.</p>
		<p>Today, the Tambdi Surla Temple is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and is well-preserved as both a heritage site and a place of active worship. The temple continues to celebrate important festivals, with Mahashivaratri being the most significant event, attracting pilgrims and tourists alike. Access to the temple requires a short trek through forested paths, making it a popular destination for heritage enthusiasts and nature lovers. It remains one of Goa’s most authentic links to its pre-Portuguese Hindu past, symbolizing resilience, sacred continuity, and architectural elegance that has withstood the test of time.</p>
