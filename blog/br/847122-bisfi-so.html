		<p>Vidyapati Thakur, born around 1352 in the village of Bisapi in Madhubani, Bihar, was a distinguished Maithili Brahmin poet and scholar. His upbringing in a Brahmin family ensured rigorous training in Sanskrit, laying the foundation for his extensive literary contributions.</p>
		<p>Vidyapati's literary journey began under the patronage of King Kirti Simha, who reigned circa 1370–1380. During this period, he composed "Kirtilata" ("Vine of Glory"), a poem celebrating the king's achievements. He continued his scholarly pursuits at the court of Kirti Simha's son, Deva Simha, for whom he wrote "Bhuparikrama" ("Around the World"), a compilation of romantic tales interwoven with political and religious counsel.</p>
		<p>Between 1380 and 1406, Vidyapati crafted over five hundred love songs, primarily focusing on the divine romance between Radha and Krishna. These compositions, written in the Maithili language, marked a departure from the traditional use of Sanskrit for literary works. By employing Maithili, Vidyapati made literature more accessible to the common people, enriching the cultural tapestry of the region. His poetry delved into the myriad emotions of love, capturing the essence of passion, longing, and devotion. Unlike his predecessor Jayadeva, whose works predominantly reflected a masculine perspective, Vidyapati's songs often portrayed Radha's feminine sentiments, offering a nuanced exploration of her emotions.</p>
		<p>The political upheavals of 1406, marked by Muslim invasions, led to the disappearance of his patron and friend, Shiva Simha. This turmoil forced Vidyapati into exile in Nepal, where he authored "Likhanavali," a guide on Sanskrit letter writing. Upon his return to Mithila around 1418, he shifted his literary focus, producing several scholarly works in Sanskrit. These included treatises on ethics, law, and religious rituals, such as "Purusha Pariksha," "Vibhagasara," and "Durgabhaktitarangini." It is believed that he retired from the court around 1430, spending his remaining years in his native village until his death in 1448.</p>
		<p>Vidyapati's influence extended beyond Maithili literature. In Bengal, his love songs were embraced by Vaishnavas like Chaitanya and Chandidas, leading to the development of "Brajabuli," an artificial literary language that blended Maithili with Bengali elements. This linguistic innovation inspired medieval Bengali poets such as Gobindadas Kabiraj and Jnandas. Centuries later, Rabindranath Tagore composed "Bhanusingha Thakurer Padabali" in Brajabuli, reflecting Vidyapati's enduring impact. In Odisha, his influence permeated through Bengal, inspiring poets like Ramananda Raya, a disciple of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who composed Brajabuli poems that resonated with the themes and styles of Vidyapati's works.</p>
