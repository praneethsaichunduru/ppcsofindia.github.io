		<p><b><i>Adi Shankaracharya</i></b>, also known as <b><i>Adi Shankara</i></b>, was an 8th-century Indian philosopher and theologian who played a pivotal role in the revival and consolidation of <b><i>Hinduism</i></b> during a time when <b><i>Buddhism</i></b> and other heterodox philosophies were prominent across the Indian subcontinent. Born in <b><i>Kalady</i></b>, present-day Kerala, around <b><i>788 CE</i></b> (though dates vary between 788–820 CE and 509–477 BCE in some traditional accounts), Shankaracharya is widely regarded as one of the most important spiritual figures in Indian history. He is believed to have been a prodigy who mastered the <b><i>Vedas</i></b> by the age of eight and took <b><i>sannyasa</i></b> (renunciation) early in life under the guidance of <b><i>Govinda Bhagavatpada</i></b>, a disciple of <b><i>Gaudapada</i></b>, who belonged to the Advaita tradition.</p>
		<p>Shankaracharya’s foremost contribution to Hinduism is his revival and systematization of the <b><i>Advaita Vedanta</i></b> school of philosophy. <b><i>Advaita Vedanta</i></b> teaches the non-duality (<b><i>advaita</i></b>) of the soul (<b><i>atman</i></b>) and the ultimate reality (<b><i>Brahman</i></b>), asserting that the individual self and the universal consciousness are one and the same. He argued that the apparent multiplicity of the world is an illusion (<b><i>maya</i></b>), and that liberation (<b><i>moksha</i></b>) is achieved through the realization of this fundamental unity. His interpretations were deeply rooted in the <b><i>Upanishads</i></b>, <b><i>Bhagavad Gita</i></b>, and <b><i>Brahma Sutras</i></b>—collectively known as the <b><i>Prasthana Traya</i></b>—for which he wrote extensive commentaries. These commentaries laid the philosophical foundation for subsequent developments in Hindu thought and remain central texts in Hindu theology and philosophy.</p>
		<p>In addition to philosophical works, Adi Shankaracharya composed numerous devotional hymns and <b><i>stotras</i></b> in praise of various Hindu deities including <b><i>Shiva</i></b>, <b><i>Vishnu</i></b>, <b><i>Devi</i></b>, and others. Among his most famous hymns are <b><i>Bhaja Govindam</i></b>, <b><i>Saundarya Lahari</i></b>, <b><i>Dakshinamurti Stotra</i></b>, and <b><i>Shivananda Lahari</i></b>. These works reflect both his intellectual rigor and devotional fervor, combining metaphysical insight with poetic elegance. He promoted the worship of multiple deities while maintaining the non-dualistic principle that all forms are manifestations of the same ultimate reality. This inclusive approach contributed significantly to the unification of diverse sects within Hinduism.</p>
		<p>Shankaracharya also played a strategic role in the institutional organization of Hindu monasticism. He established four monastic centers (<b><i>mathas</i></b>) in the cardinal directions of India—<b><i>Sringeri</i></b> in the south, <b><i>Dwaraka</i></b> in the west, <b><i>Puri</i></b> in the east, and <b><i>Jyotirmath</i></b> (Joshimath) in the north—each entrusted to one of his principal disciples. These <b><i>mathas</i></b> continue to function as spiritual and philosophical hubs, preserving <b><i>Advaita Vedanta</i></b> and guiding millions of followers. He is also associated with formalizing the tradition of the <b><i>Dashanami Sampradaya</i></b>, a classification of ten monastic orders for renunciants.</p>
		<p>Adi Shankaracharya undertook extensive journeys across the Indian subcontinent, engaging in <b><i>shastrarthas</i></b> (philosophical debates) with proponents of various schools of thought, including <b><i>Mimamsa</i></b>, <b><i>Samkhya</i></b>, <b><i>Buddhism</i></b>, and <b><i>Jainism</i></b>. His debates, particularly with <b><i>Mandana Mishra</i></b>, are legendary and symbolically represent the reassertion of Vedantic ideals. Through these intellectual engagements, he reinvigorated <b><i>Hindu dharma</i></b> and secured the place of Vedanta as a dominant philosophical school. His short life—he is believed to have passed away at the age of 32—left an enduring legacy that continues to shape Indian spirituality, philosophy, and culture.</p>
