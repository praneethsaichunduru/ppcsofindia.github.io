		<p>Thrissur Pooram is one of the most magnificent temple festivals in Kerala, celebrated in the city of Thrissur. The festival traces its origins to the late 18th century when Maharaja Rama Varma, famously known as Sakthan Thampuran, the ruler of Cochin, unified various regional temple festivals into a grand, centralized event. Prior to this, temple festivals in and around Thrissur were conducted independently, and often some temples were excluded from major celebrations. To resolve this issue, Sakthan Thampuran brought together ten temples around Vadakkunnathan Temple, creating what is now known as Thrissur Pooram. Over time, the festival has grown into Kerala’s most anticipated and visually spectacular temple festival.</p>
		<p>Thrissur Pooram is an annual festival held in the Malayalam month of Medam, which typically falls in April or May. The main events take place on the Pooram (പൂരം) day, which is when the moon rises in the Pooram star of the Malayalam calendar. The festival spans over a week, with various cultural and religious activities leading up to the grand culmination at the Thekkinkadu Maidanam, the ground surrounding the historic Vadakkunnathan Temple.</p>
		<p>The festival is centered around a friendly rivalry between two temple groups—Paramekkavu and Thiruvambady, both competing to showcase the grandest elephants, percussion performances, and firework displays. The festival officially begins with the flag hoisting at various participating temples. The Kudamattom ceremony, where vibrant parasols are swiftly changed atop elaborately adorned elephants, is a highlight of the festival. Other important rituals include the grand processions of decorated elephants, known as Ezhunnallippu and the Pandimelam, a mesmerizing orchestration of traditional percussion instruments.</p>
		<p>The festival is famous for its grand firework display, which takes place in the early hours of the concluding day. The pyrotechnics involve the use of traditional techniques and are conducted in two rounds—one in the evening and a more extravagant display before dawn. The rhythmic and electrifying percussion ensembles such as Panchavadyam and Melam add to the high-energy atmosphere. Another major attraction is the parade of caparisoned elephants, with each temple bringing forth its finest elephants, adorned with intricate golden headpieces called Nettipattam,  peacock-feather fans, and silk parasols.</p>
		<p>Though a Hindu temple festival, Thrissur Pooram has transcended religious boundaries, drawing people of all faiths. The event is deeply embedded in Kerala’s cultural fabric and significantly boosts tourism and local businesses. Temporary shops and food stalls line the streets, selling everything from traditional Kerala snacks to festival souvenirs. The Vadakkunnathan Temple, despite being at the center of the festival, does not participate directly in the Pooram, maintaining its age-old customs. The community-driven nature of Thrissur Pooram makes it not just a festival but an experience of unity, tradition, and grandeur.</p>
