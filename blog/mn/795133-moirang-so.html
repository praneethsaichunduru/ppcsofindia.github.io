		<p>The Sangai deer (<i>Rucervus eldii eldii</i>), often called the "dancing deer" of Manipur, is one of the most unique and endangered deer species in the world. It is endemic to the northeastern Indian state of Manipur and is found exclusively in the Keibul Lamjao National Park, located in the southern part of Loktak Lake, the largest freshwater lake in northeastern India. The Sangai is a subspecies of the Eld's deer (also known as Thamin), which has two other subspecies found in Myanmar and Southeast Asia. Its restricted range and specialized habitat make its conservation both critical and challenging.</p>
		<p>The Sangai is named after its graceful gait, which gives the impression of dancing as it moves over the floating biomass of phumdis—thick, heterogeneous masses of vegetation, soil, and organic matter in various stages of decomposition that float on the surface of Loktak Lake. These phumdis are a vital part of the deer’s habitat, providing both shelter and sustenance. The Sangai is medium-sized, with a shoulder height of around 115–125 cm, and is known for its distinctive antlers that can grow up to 100 cm long and have a pronounced brow tine that gives the antlers a bow-like appearance. Males are larger than females and possess the characteristic antlers, while females are smaller and lack antlers.</p>
		<p>The Sangai’s habitat is extremely fragile. Keibul Lamjao National Park, the world’s only floating national park, covers an area of about 40 square kilometers. The phumdis are highly sensitive to changes in water levels. The construction of the Ithai Barrage in 1983, part of the Loktak Hydroelectric Project, altered the hydrology of the lake by maintaining constant water levels. This severely affected the natural cycle of phumdis, which traditionally sank during the dry season and regenerated during the monsoon. The altered cycle has led to thinning and degradation of the phumdis, threatening the Sangai’s habitat and survival.</p>
		<p>The Sangai was once thought to be extinct in the 1950s but was rediscovered in 1953 by a forest officer. Since then, conservation efforts have increased. The deer was declared an endangered species by the IUCN and is listed under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, providing it the highest level of legal protection in India. As of the latest reports (2023), the Sangai population is estimated to be over 260 individuals, showing a gradual increase thanks to focused conservation measures, including habitat protection, anti-poaching efforts, and awareness programs initiated by the Manipur Forest Department and wildlife organizations.</p>
		<p>Despite these gains, the Sangai remains at risk. Poaching, encroachment, and continued ecological degradation due to human activity pose ongoing threats. Community participation, especially among the local Meitei people who consider the Sangai sacred, has been instrumental in conservation efforts. The Sangai also holds cultural importance in Manipur, symbolizing the delicate balance between nature and human civilization. The annual Sangai Festival, held in November, celebrates Manipur’s rich cultural and ecological heritage, with the deer as its emblem, reinforcing the significance of its preservation.</p>
