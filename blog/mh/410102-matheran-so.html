		<p>The Matheran Hill Railway (MHR) is a narrow-gauge heritage railway in Maharashtra, India, spanning 21 kilometers from Neral to the hill station of Matheran. Known for its scenic journey through the Western Ghats, it remains a popular attraction for tourists and a crucial transport link for locals. In the 2023-24 fiscal year, the railway served approximately 500,000 passengers, reflecting its enduring significance.</p>
		<p>The railway was constructed between 1901 and 1907 under the vision of Abdul Hussein Adamjee Peerbhoy, financed by his father, Sir Adamjee Peerbhoy, at a cost of ₹16 lakh. Frequent visits to Matheran inspired Abdul Hussein to make the hill station more accessible. Construction began in 1904 with Everard Calthrop as the consulting engineer, and by 1907, the line became operational. Initially, steam locomotives with Klien-Lindner axles were used, designed to navigate the railway’s sharp curves and steep gradients. By 1982, these were replaced with diesel locomotives, including Class NDM1 and NDM6 models, which improved efficiency while maintaining the nostalgic charm.</p>
		<p>The journey on the MHR offers stunning views of the Western Ghats, dense forests, and steep cliffs. Highlights of the route include the One-Kiss Tunnel and several zigzag sections, allowing passengers to experience a slow, immersive journey through nature. The train operates at a speed limit of 12 km/h due to the steep gradients and sharp curves. This leisurely pace allows travelers to appreciate the scenic beauty, making the ride a cherished experience distinct from modern high-speed travel.</p>
		<p>Over the years, the railway has faced challenges, including landslides and derailments, leading to service suspensions. A major suspension in 2016 due to derailments was followed by extensive safety upgrades, including crash barriers and reinforced track sections, leading to a full resumption of services in 2018. Maintenance efforts continue to ensure safety and reliability, allowing the train to operate smoothly. To boost tourism, the Central Railway has also introduced pod hotels at Matheran, providing better accommodation options for visitors.</p>
		<p>The MHR is currently on UNESCO’s tentative list of World Heritage Sites, recognizing its cultural and historical importance. While it has not yet achieved full heritage status, preservation efforts continue to safeguard its legacy. Its unique appeal, historical significance, and ongoing improvements ensure that the Matheran Toy Train remains a treasured part of India’s railway heritage and a favorite among travelers.</p>
