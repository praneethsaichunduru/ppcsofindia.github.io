		<p>Panchakki, located in Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar (formerly Aurangabad), Maharashtra, is a remarkable 17th-century water mill that exemplifies medieval Indian engineering and architecture. Constructed around 1695 CE by Turktaz Khan, a noble under Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah, the structure was designed to harness the energy of flowing water to operate grinding stones for flour production. The complex is part of the dargah (shrine) of the Sufi saint Baba Shah Musafir and includes a mosque, madrasa, minister’s residence, court (kacheri), inn (sarai), and women's quarters (zananas), all set within a serene garden near the Mahmud Darwaza .</p>
		<p>The engineering marvel of Panchakki lies in its water management system. Water is channeled from a spring located approximately 6 to 8 kilometers away through an underground conduit. This water is directed into an elevated masonry pillar, from which it cascades down into a cistern, generating the kinetic energy needed to turn the mill's grinding stones. The cistern, measuring about 164 feet by 31 feet, also serves as the roof of a spacious hall that remains cool during the summer months, providing a comfortable space for pilgrims . Excess water from the system is released into the Kham River, demonstrating an early understanding of sustainable water use.</p>
		<p>Historically, Panchakki served multiple purposes. It was primarily used to grind grain for pilgrims visiting the dargah, as well as for the troops stationed in the area. The flour produced was used to prepare food for these visitors, highlighting the site's role in supporting both religious and military communities . The complex also housed a library established in the 18th century, which once contained around 100,000 books and manuscripts in various languages, including Arabic, Persian, and Urdu, covering subjects like medicine, science, law, philosophy, and Sufism. Although the library was closed in the 1970s, it has since reopened and currently holds approximately 2,500 books.</p>
		<p>Today, Panchakki stands as a testament to the ingenuity of medieval Indian architecture and engineering. The site is maintained by the Maharashtra State Board of Waqf and continues to attract visitors interested in its historical and spiritual significance . The surrounding gardens, fountains, and the tomb of Baba Shah Musafir add to the site's tranquil ambiance, making it a peaceful retreat for tourists and devotees alike. The complex is open to visitors from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, with an entry fee of ₹5 for Indian citizens and ₹100 for foreign tourists.</p>
		<p>In addition to its historical and architectural significance, Panchakki is enveloped in local legends and spiritual lore. It is believed that Baba Shah Musafir possessed miraculous powers, including the ability to turn water into oil to help the needy . Such stories contribute to the site's mystique and continue to draw pilgrims seeking blessings and solace. The blend of practical engineering, spiritual heritage, and natural beauty makes Panchakki a unique and enduring symbol of India's rich cultural tapestry.</p>
