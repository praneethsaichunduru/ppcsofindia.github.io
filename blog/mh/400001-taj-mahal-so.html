		<p>The Gateway of India, an iconic arch monument in Mumbai, was built to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to India in December 1911. Designed by Scottish architect George Wittet, the structure blends Indo-Saracenic, Mughal, and Gothic architectural styles. Standing 26 meters tall, it was constructed using yellow basalt and reinforced concrete. The foundation stone was laid in 1913, and after a decade of construction, the monument was officially inaugurated in 1924. It was intended as a ceremonial entrance for British dignitaries and a symbol of colonial grandeur.</p>
		<p>The structure features intricate latticework (jaali), arched windows, and four turrets that showcase a fusion of Indian and Islamic designs. The large central archway was designed to welcome ships arriving in Bombay (now Mumbai). The open seafront location enhances its grandeur, making it a major landmark of the city. Built to overlook the Arabian Sea, the Gateway was historically a point of entry for governors and viceroys during British rule.</p>
    	<p>The Gateway of India also played a crucial role in India’s history. In 1948, the last British troops departed through this arch, marking the end of colonial rule. Over the years, it has been a site of many political and social events. In 1961, a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji was placed near the monument, replacing a statue of King George V, symbolizing India's shift towards its own heritage. Today, it remains a significant cultural and historical landmark.</p>
    	<p>Tourists and locals visit the Gateway daily, making it one of Mumbai’s busiest attractions. It serves as the starting point for ferries to Elephanta Caves, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. However, the monument has also witnessed tragic events, including the 2003 bomb blasts and the 2008 Mumbai attacks, which targeted the adjacent Taj Mahal Palace hotel. Despite these incidents, it continues to be a symbol of resilience.</p>
    	<p>Regular maintenance efforts are undertaken to preserve its structure, as weathering from sea air and pollution pose challenges. Conservation projects focus on cleaning and restoring the stonework while ensuring that the architectural details remain intact. As an enduring symbol of Mumbai’s colonial past and evolving identity, the Gateway of India remains a defining feature of the city’s landscape.</p>
