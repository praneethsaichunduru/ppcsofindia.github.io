		<p>Shaniwar Wada, a historic fortification in Pune, Maharashtra, was built in 1732 as the seat of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire. Commissioned by Peshwa Baji Rao I, the structure was designed to reflect the grandeur and power of the Marathas. It was constructed using a combination of stone for the foundation and brick for the upper walls. The fort’s architecture featured influences of Maratha, Mughal, and Rajput styles, with intricately designed gates, spacious halls, and elaborate fountains. The fort originally covered an area of about 625 acres, with its main entrance, the Delhi Darwaza, being large enough to allow elephants to pass through.</p>
		<p>Shaniwar Wada played a crucial role in the Maratha Empire, serving as the political and administrative headquarters of the Peshwas. It witnessed significant events, including the rise of the Peshwas as dominant leaders in India. Baji Rao I and his successors conducted military strategies and diplomatic affairs from within its walls. The wada also became a center of cultural patronage, where literature, music, and art flourished. Despite its grandeur, the fort was not immune to political turmoil, and internal conflicts within the Peshwa family often resulted in power struggles that impacted the empire’s stability.</p>
		<p>A major turning point in Shaniwar Wada’s history was the devastating fire of 1828, which destroyed most of the structure. The cause of the fire remains uncertain, but it raged for several days, reducing the fort’s wooden interiors to ashes. Prior to this, the site had already seen bloodshed, most notably the assassination of Narayanrao Peshwa in 1773, which led to tragic events that haunt its legacy. Today, locals and visitors speak of paranormal activities, with reports of eerie sounds, particularly cries of “Kaka mala vachva” (Uncle, save me), believed to be Narayanrao’s last words.</p>
		<p>Currently, Shaniwar Wada stands as a major tourist attraction and historical site. Though only remnants of its original grandeur remain, visitors can still see the imposing gates, the sturdy stone walls, the foundations of old structures, and the surviving fountains and gardens. The site is managed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), and efforts have been made to preserve what remains of the fort. Light and sound shows are organized in the evenings, narrating the history of the fort and the Maratha Empire, drawing both history enthusiasts and tourists alike.</p>
		<p>Apart from its historical significance, Shaniwar Wada continues to be a cultural symbol of Pune. It has been featured in literature, films, and television, further cementing its place in popular imagination. Its location in the heart of Pune makes it an easily accessible landmark, attracting thousands of visitors each year. The fort remains a poignant reminder of the Maratha Empire’s power, architectural brilliance, and turbulent history.</p>
