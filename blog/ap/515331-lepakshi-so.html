			<p>Lepakshi, a small village in the Sri Sathya Sai district of Andhra Pradesh, holds a unique place in India's spiritual and cultural landscape. The name “Lepakshi” is believed to originate from the words “Le Pakshi,” meaning “Rise, O Bird” in Telugu. This expression is tied to the legend of Jatayu from the Ramayana. According to the tradition, Jatayu, the divine vulture and devotee of Lord Rama, valiantly attempted to stop Ravana from abducting Sita. After being mortally wounded, he fell at this site. When Rama found the dying Jatayu and granted him liberation, he is said to have uttered “Le Pakshi,” commanding the bird to rise and attain moksha. This spiritual resonance makes Lepakshi an important pilgrimage destination.</p>
			<p>The Veerabhadra Swamy Temple in Lepakshi is a 16th-century architectural marvel built during the Vijayanagara Empire under the patronage of Viranna and Virupanna, governors of Penukonda under King Achyuta Deva Raya. The temple is dedicated to Veerabhadra, a fierce form of Lord Shiva created by him in a moment of wrath. According to sacred lore, Veerabhadra was born when Shiva, devastated by the self-immolation of his consort Sati during Daksha's yagna, plucked a lock of his hair and dashed it on the ground. This manifestation of Shiva embodies righteous anger and divine justice.</p>
			<p>The temple is renowned for its exquisite Vijayanagara architecture, featuring intricately carved pillars, frescoes, and sculptural depictions from sacred epics. One of the highlights of the temple is the famed “hanging pillar” in the main hall, which does not rest entirely on the ground—an architectural feat that continues to astonish engineers and visitors alike. The temple’s ceilings are adorned with murals depicting scenes from the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranic traditions, showcasing the artistic mastery of the time.</p>
			<p>Situated about 200 meters from the temple complex is the colossal monolithic Nandi (bull), which is among the largest of its kind in India. Carved from a single granite rock, the Nandi measures approximately 20 feet in length and 15 feet in height. It faces the Veerabhadra temple in the traditional alignment seen in Shaivite shrines, symbolizing unwavering devotion. The sculpture is celebrated not only for its sheer size but also for its finely detailed workmanship, with carved garlands, bells, and expressive features that convey both grandeur and serenity.</p>
			<p>The entire Lepakshi complex is enveloped in sacred and historical significance, combining spiritual narratives, artistic excellence, and architectural innovation. From the footprint said to belong to Sita (known locally as “Sita Paadam”) to the dramatic stone friezes portraying mythic tales, the site serves as a cultural repository of South Indian spiritual heritage. Its legacy continues to inspire scholars, artists, and devotees who visit this timeless testament to faith and craftsmanship.</p>
