		<p>Tallapaka Annamacharya (1408–1503) was a prolific saint-poet and composer from the Vijayanagara Empire, renowned for his devotional compositions dedicated to Lord Venkateswara of Tirumala. He was born in Tallapaka, a village in present-day Andhra Pradesh, into a family of Nandavarika Brahmins. Legends suggest that he was divinely inspired from a young age, composing his first song at the age of sixteen when he had a vision of Lord Venkateswara. Annamacharya chose a life of devotion and dedicated his compositions to expressing his unwavering faith in the deity. He traveled extensively, spreading the message of bhakti (devotion) and composed thousands of keertanas in Telugu, making him one of the earliest known Telugu composers.</p>
		<p>During his lifetime, Annamacharya faced opposition for promoting bhakti as a direct path to salvation, bypassing rigid caste structures. Despite resistance, he continued his mission, composing over 32,000 devotional songs, of which only about 12,000 have survived. His compositions, primarily in simple yet profound Telugu, conveyed spiritual and philosophical themes, making them accessible to people across different social backgrounds. He also wrote Sanskrit compositions, including ‘Venkateswara Shatakam’ and ‘Sankeertana Lakshanam,’ showcasing his erudition. His literary works blend devotion with poetic excellence, reflecting his deep understanding of classical music and philosophy.</p>
		<p>Annamacharya was a key figure in the Bhakti movement, which emphasized personal devotion over ritualistic practices. His songs were set to music in the Carnatic style, and he is regarded as the pioneer of Telugu keerthanas. His compositions often describe the grandeur of Lord Venkateswara, while also addressing moral values, social issues, and human emotions. He was deeply influenced by the Alwars and their Tamil hymns but distinguished himself with a unique style that celebrated the divine in everyday life. His influence extended beyond religion, as he subtly questioned societal norms and advocated equality through his lyrical poetry.</p>
		<p>Following his passing in 1503, Annamacharya’s compositions remained largely forgotten until they were rediscovered in the 20th century. Copper plates containing his works were found in the Tirumala temple, and in 1949, the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) undertook efforts to transcribe, preserve, and popularize his songs. Music composer Nedunuri Krishnamurthy and others played a significant role in reviving his keerthanas by setting them to appropriate ragas and promoting them in Carnatic music circles. His legacy was further solidified when renowned artists, including M. S. Subbulakshmi, performed his works globally, bringing his compositions to a wider audience.</p>
		<p>Today, Annamacharya is revered as one of the greatest saint-poets of South India. His compositions remain an integral part of temple rituals at Tirumala, and his influence continues through classical music concerts, research institutions, and cultural festivals. The TTD has established institutions to study his works, and statues honoring him stand in Tirupati and beyond. His life and works symbolize an enduring tradition of devotion and literary excellence, inspiring generations of musicians, scholars, and devotees.</p>
