		<p>The Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple, located on Simhachalam Hill in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, is one of the most revered temples in South India. Dedicated to Lord Narasimha, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, this temple uniquely enshrines the deity in a combined form of Varaha (boar) and Narasimha (man-lion), hence the name Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha. The temple is classified as one of the eighteen "Narasimha Kshetras" of India and is considered an important center of Vaishnavism. Simhachalam, meaning "the lion hill," derives its name from the lion-headed form of Lord Narasimha.</p>
		<p>According to legend, the temple's origin is linked to the story of the demon king Hiranyaksha and his brother Hiranyakashipu. After Hiranyaksha was slain by Lord Vishnu in the form of Varaha, Hiranyakashipu sought revenge, only to be vanquished later by the Narasimha avatar. It is believed that after this incident, Lord Narasimha remained in a fierce and wrathful form. To pacify him, Prahlada, the devout son of Hiranyakashipu, is said to have requested the Lord to take a calmer form by merging the Varaha and Narasimha avatars. The deity at Simhachalam reflects this composite form, and the temple is thus regarded as the place where Narasimha's anger was subdued.</p>
		<p>A key uniqueness of the Simhachalam temple lies in its ritual tradition. The main deity is always covered with a thick layer of sandalwood paste throughout the year, giving it the appearance of a Shivalinga. Only once a year, on the occasion of <strong>Chandana Yatra</strong> or <strong>Akshaya Tritiya</strong>, the paste is removed during a grand ritual called <em>Nijaroopa Darshanam</em>, revealing the actual form of the deity to devotees. This event draws thousands of pilgrims. The blending of Vaishnavite and Shaivite practices here, along with the dual avatar form of the deity, makes the temple distinct among Hindu shrines.</p>
		<p>Architecturally, the temple showcases a blend of the Kalinga (Odisha), Chalukya, and Dravidian styles. The temple was originally constructed in the 11th century by the Eastern Ganga dynasty and later renovated and expanded by various rulers, notably the Gajapati kings and the Vijayanagara emperors. The structure features richly carved stone pillars, intricately designed mandapas (halls), and a grand gopuram (entrance tower) typical of South Indian temple architecture. Inscriptions found in the temple premises, dating from the 11th to 19th centuries, offer valuable information about donations and renovations by kings and local devotees.</p>
		<p>The temple celebrates several important festivals, the most prominent being <strong>Chandanotsavam</strong>, held in April/May, when the sandalwood paste is ceremoniously removed. Other major festivals include <strong>Vaikuntha Ekadashi</strong>, <strong>Narasimha Jayanti</strong>, and <strong>Brahmotsavam</strong>. The temple is managed by the Endowments Department of Andhra Pradesh and is visited by lakhs of devotees every year. Simhachalam is not only a pilgrimage center but also a symbol of religious harmony, as people from various backgrounds visit to seek the blessings of the Lord. The temple’s serene location on a forested hill and its deep spiritual heritage make it a must-visit sacred site in India.</p>
