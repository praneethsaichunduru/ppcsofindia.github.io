		<p>Sri Aurobindo Ashram, located in Puducherry, is a spiritual center founded by Sri Aurobindo and his close collaborator, Mirra Alfassa, known as "The Mother." Sri Aurobindo, born in 1872 in Kolkata, was educated in England and later became a revolutionary in India's independence movement. After facing imprisonment, he moved to Pondicherry in 1910, where he devoted himself to spirituality and developed Integral Yoga, a philosophy aimed at transforming human life into a divine existence.</p>
		<p>Mirra Alfassa, born in Paris in 1878, was deeply involved in spiritual studies. She met Sri Aurobindo in 1914 and recognized him as the spiritual guide she had envisioned. In 1920, she returned to Pondicherry and worked closely with him. When Sri Aurobindo withdrew from public life in 1926, she took charge of the ashram and became its guiding force, earning the title "The Mother."</p>
		<p>The ashram was formally established on November 24, 1926, following a significant spiritual realization by Sri Aurobindo. Initially, it comprised a small group of around 24 disciples who dedicated themselves to the practice of Integral Yoga, which seeks the transformation of human life into a divine existence through spiritual evolution. The Mother assumed responsibility for the day-to-day management and spiritual guidance of the community, allowing Sri Aurobindo to focus on his writings and inner work. The ashram emphasized a holistic approach to spiritual practice, integrating physical, mental, and spiritual development.</p>
		<p>Under The Mother's stewardship, the ashram experienced significant growth. By 1934, the community had expanded to over 150 members, necessitating the development of various departments to cater to the residents' needs. These included facilities for dining, libraries, workshops, farms, dairies, medical care, and cultural activities such as music, dance, and theatre. Physical education was also emphasized, with activities like sports, yoga asanas, and swimming forming an integral part of daily life. The ashram's routine featured regular interactions with The Mother, including morning blessings, individual meetings, and collective meditations. Additionally, four times a year, public darshans were held, drawing thousands of devotees seeking spiritual guidance.</p>
		<p>Today, the Sri Aurobindo Ashram stands as a vibrant center for spiritual practice and learning, with a community of approximately 1,600 members. Including students from the Centre of Education and nearby devotees, the larger community comprises over 2,000 individuals. The ashram continues to provide for the holistic well-being of its members, offering resources for material and spiritual needs. The main building houses the Samadhi, a white marble shrine in a tree-shaded courtyard, where the physical remains of Sri Aurobindo and The Mother are enshrined. Managed by the Sri Aurobindo Ashram Trust, established by The Mother in 1955, the ashram remains dedicated to the pursuit of Integral Yoga and the vision of human unity and transformation.</p>
