		<p>Aayi Mandapam, also known as the Park Monument, is a distinguished white structure situated at the heart of Bharathi Park in Puducherry, India. Constructed in 1854 during the reign of French Emperor Napoleon III, this monument honors Aayi, a courtesan whose altruistic act significantly contributed to the city's water supply system. The edifice, designed in the Greco-Roman architectural style by French architect Louis Gurre, features a domed roof supported by fluted circular twin columns and crowned with pediments, one of which depicts Aayi holding a pot.</p>
		<p>The story of Aayi dates back to the early 16th century during the Vijayanagara Empire under King Krishnadevaraya. While visiting Pondicherry, the king mistook Aayi's beautifully adorned house for a temple and paid homage to it. Upon realizing it was the residence of a courtesan, he ordered its demolition. In response, Aayi herself tore down her home and constructed a water tank in its place to serve the local community. Centuries later, this tank played a crucial role in alleviating water scarcity in the French-occupied city.</p>
		<p>During the 18th century, Pondicherry faced significant water shortages. French engineer Pierre-Eugène Lamairesse discovered the tank built by Aayi in Muthurayarpalayam and devised a system to channel water through canals to the area now known as Bharathi Park. Impressed by Aayi's selflessness, Emperor Napoleon III commissioned the construction of Aayi Mandapam to commemorate her contribution to the city's welfare.</p>
		<p>Today, Aayi Mandapam stands as a central feature within Bharathi Park, surrounded by well-maintained lawns, fountains, and vibrant flora. The park serves as a popular spot for both locals and tourists, offering a serene environment for walks and leisure activities. Despite its historical significance, the monument has experienced periods of neglect. As of 2015, reports indicated the presence of cracks and black patches on the structure, highlighting the need for restoration efforts to preserve this heritage site.</p>
		<p>spirit of selflessness and communal service. Its enduring presence in Puducherry continues to inspire and remind visitors of the profound impact one individual's actions can have on society.</p>
