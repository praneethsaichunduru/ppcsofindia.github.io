		<p>The <b>Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple</b> in Madurai stands as one of the most magnificent and historically significant temples in India. Dedicated to Goddess Meenakshi (a form of Parvati) and Lord Sundareswarar (Shiva), this temple is not just a center of worship but also a symbol of Tamil culture, architecture, and spiritual devotion. The temple finds mention in ancient Tamil texts such as the <i>Silappadikaram</i> and <i>Tiruvilaiyadal Puranam</i>, which highlight its role as a major pilgrimage site for Shaivites. The city's history and its association with this temple date back over two millennia, with Madurai being one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world.</p>
    		<p>According to legend, Meenakshi was born to King Malayadwaja Pandian and Queen Kanchanamala as a three-breasted child, fulfilling a divine prophecy that her third breast would disappear when she met her destined consort. She grew into a powerful warrior and later encountered Lord Shiva in the form of Sundareswarar. Upon seeing him, her third breast vanished, signifying their divine union. Their wedding is grandly celebrated as <b>Meenakshi Thirukalyanam</b> during the Chithirai festival, where thousands of devotees participate in the celestial event. The festival also features the procession of Lord Kallazhagar, a form of Vishnu, from Azhagar Koyil into the Vaigai River, symbolizing his journey to witness his sister’s wedding. This annual festival unites Shaivite and Vaishnavite traditions, making it one of Tamil Nadu’s most significant religious celebrations.</p>
    		<p>The temple has witnessed periods of destruction and revival over the centuries. During the 14th century, the forces of the Delhi Sultanate led by Malik Kafur invaded Madurai, leading to the desecration of the temple and the loss of many of its treasures. However, the Vijayanagara Empire played a crucial role in its restoration during the 16th century, bringing back its former glory. Later, the Nayak kings of Madurai, particularly Thirumalai Nayak (1623–1659), made significant contributions to the temple's expansion and beautification, adding grand corridors, majestic towers (gopurams), and intricate sculptures that stand today as a testimony to their patronage.</p>
    		<p>The temple complex is a marvel of Dravidian architecture, spread across 14 acres, with towering gopurams that are elaborately adorned with thousands of colorful sculptures depicting deities, mythical creatures, and celestial beings. The most striking among them is the South Tower, which rises to a height of about 170 feet. The temple has a total of 14 gopurams, with the tallest belonging to Sundareswarar. Inside, the Hall of Thousand Pillars (Aayiram Kaal Mandapam) is an architectural masterpiece, showcasing intricately carved stone pillars that reveal different artistic forms when viewed from various angles. The temple also houses a sacred golden lotus tank (Porthamarai Kulam), which has been a spiritual site for devotees for centuries.</p>
