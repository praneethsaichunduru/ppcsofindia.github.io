		<p>Ramana Maharshi, born Venkataraman Iyer on December 30, 1879, in Tamil Nadu, India, is revered as one of the most influential spiritual teachers of modern times. His teachings, centered on self-inquiry and the realization of one's true nature, have attracted seekers globally. At the age of 16, Venkataraman experienced a profound spiritual awakening triggered by an intense fear of death. This led him to a deep introspection, culminating in the realization that while the body is mortal, the true self is eternal and indestructible. This epiphany marked the beginning of his transformation into Ramana Maharshi.</p>
		<p>Following his awakening, Ramana felt an irresistible pull towards Arunachala, a sacred hill in Tiruvannamalai, which he regarded as his spiritual abode and a manifestation of Lord Shiva. In 1896, he renounced his familial ties and worldly possessions to settle at Arunachala, dedicating his life to deep meditation and self-inquiry. Living in caves and temples around the hill, he immersed himself in profound states of meditation, leading to a state of enlightenment. His serene presence and profound wisdom soon attracted devotees from various backgrounds, all seeking guidance on their spiritual journeys.</p>
		<p>Central to Ramana Maharshi's teachings is the practice of self-inquiry, known as "Atma Vichara." He advocated for individuals to introspectively question "Who am I?" to transcend the ego and realize their true self. This method emphasizes that liberation is not an external pursuit but an internal realization of one's inherent divinity. He also highlighted the illusory nature of the ego, asserting that by understanding its unreality, one can experience unity with the infinite. His teachings align with the principles of Advaita Vedanta, which posits that the individual soul and the supreme reality are one and the same.</p>
		<p>In 1922, a small ashram, Sri Ramanasramam, was established at the base of Arunachala to accommodate the growing number of devotees. The ashram became a sanctuary for spiritual seekers, offering a serene environment for meditation, self-inquiry, and contemplation. Facilities within the ashram include the Main Hall, where daily meditation sessions and chanting occur, and the Old Hall, where Ramana spent much of his life teaching and guiding his followers. The ashram also houses the Samadhi Shrine, where Ramana's mortal remains are interred, serving as a focal point for devotees to pay their respects and meditate.</p>
		<p>Sri Ramanasramam continues to uphold Ramana Maharshi's legacy, attracting visitors worldwide who seek inner peace and self-realization. The ashram maintains a structured schedule of daily activities, including meditation sessions, chanting, scriptural readings, and self-inquiry practices. Accommodations are modest, reflecting the ashram's emphasis on simplicity and detachment from material possessions. The sacred Arunachala Hill remains integral to the ashram's spiritual ambiance, with many devotees undertaking the practice of Girivalam, the circumambulation of the hill, considered a potent spiritual exercise.</p>
