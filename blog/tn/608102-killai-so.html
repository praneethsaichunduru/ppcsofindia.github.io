		<p>The Pichavaram Mangrove Forest, located near Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu's Cuddalore district, is one of India's largest mangrove ecosystems, covering approximately 1,478.6 hectares. Situated between the Vellar and Coleroon estuaries, this unique wetland comprises a network of islands interspersed with waterways, creating a complex and vibrant ecosystem. The forest communicates with the sea through a shallow passage and features numerous channels linked to the Vellar, Coleroon, and Uppanar rivers, offering abundant opportunities for water sports such as rowing, kayaking, and canoeing.</p>
		<p>Designated as a Ramsar site on April 8, 2022, Pichavaram is recognized for its ecological significance. The mangrove vegetation includes species like Avicennia and Rhizophora, and the site hosts a natural hybrid species, Rhizophora annamalayana, derived from two species of Rhizophora: R. apiculata and another natural hybrid R. mucronata. The forest supports several threatened species, such as the critically endangered great white-bellied heron (Ardea insignis) and spoon-billed sandpiper (Eurynorhynchus pygmeus), the endangered spotted greenshank (Tringa guttifer), and the vulnerable olive ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea).</p>
		<p>The mangroves also attract a diverse array of bird species, including snipes, cormorants, egrets, storks, herons, spoonbills, and pelicans. About 177 species of birds belonging to 15 orders and 41 families have been recorded in the area. The high bird population is most noticeable from November to January, coinciding with the arrival of migratory species and the availability of prey. The variety of habitats, such as channels, creeks, gullies, mudflats, and sand flats, along with the adjacent seashore, offers ideal conditions for different bird species.</p>
		<p>Beyond its ecological importance, Pichavaram plays a crucial role in supporting the livelihoods of over 1,000 families through artisanal fishing, firewood collection, non-timber forest product harvesting, and grazing lands for livestock. The mangrove ecosystem acts as a bio-shield during natural disasters, stabilizing shorelines, reducing erosion, and serving as a buffer zone between land and sea. It also provides spawning and nursing grounds for commercially important prawns, crabs, and fish, thereby enhancing fishery production in the area. </p>
		<p>Recognizing the significance of this habitat, the Tamil Nadu Forest Department has initiated plans to restore degraded areas in Pichavaram and increase the mangrove cover by 100 hectares for the year 2023-24. This effort aims to rehabilitate coastal habitats, create bio-shields, and ensure the long-term sustainability of this vital ecosystem. The department has also planned the development of a bio-shield by planting non-mangrove species such as casuarina and palmyra on 10 hectares to protect the coast from extreme weather events like cyclones, floods, and rising sea levels.</p>
