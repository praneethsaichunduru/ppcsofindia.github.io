		<p>The Palani Murugan Temple, also known as the Arulmigu Dandayudhapani Swamy Temple, is situated atop the Sivagiri Hills in Palani, Tamil Nadu, at an elevation of approximately 150 meters. It is one of the six sacred abodes (Arupadai Veedu) of Lord Murugan and holds immense significance in Tamil culture and spirituality. The temple's origins trace back to the Chera king Cheraman Perumal, who, guided by a divine vision, discovered the idol of Lord Murugan and established the temple. Subsequent contributions from the Chola, Pandya, and Nayaka dynasties enriched the temple's architecture, evident in its intricate mandapams and towering gopurams. The temple is also referenced in ancient Tamil literature, notably in the Sangam-era work <i>Thirumurugattrupadai</i>, where Palani is referred to as 'Podhini', highlighting its longstanding religious prominence.</p>
		<p>The temple's deity, Lord Dandayudhapani, is depicted as a renunciate, symbolizing wisdom and asceticism. The idol, believed to be crafted by the Siddhar Bhogar, is made from 'Navapashanam'—a blend of nine poisonous substances that, when combined, are thought to have medicinal properties. This unique composition is believed to imbue the idol with healing powers, and the abhishekam (ritual bathing) liquids are considered especially potent. The temple's rituals and offerings, including the renowned 'Panchamirtham'—a mixture of banana, honey, ghee, jaggery, and cardamom—are integral to its spiritual practices.</p>
		<p>A central legend associated with the temple involves a contest between Lord Murugan and his brother Ganesha for a divine fruit. While Murugan embarked on a journey around the world, Ganesha circled their parents, Lord Shiva and Parvati, symbolizing that they encompassed the universe. Pleased, Shiva awarded the fruit to Ganesha. Feeling slighted, Murugan retreated to the Palani Hills, embracing a life of asceticism. This act of renunciation is commemorated in the temple's traditions and underscores Murugan's embodiment of wisdom and humility.</p>
		<p>The temple is a focal point for various festivals, attracting devotees from across the region. Major celebrations include Thaipusam (January–February), Panguni Uthiram (March–April), and Skanda Sashti (October–November). During these times, devotees undertake pilgrimages, often carrying 'Kavadi'—ornate structures symbolizing burdens—to express devotion and seek blessings. The tradition of Kavadi is linked to the legend of Idumban, a devotee who carried two hills on a yoke, leading to the practice of bearing offerings to the deity.</p>
		<p>Architecturally, the temple showcases a blend of Chera and Pandya styles, featuring elaborate carvings and a majestic Raja Gopuram. Pilgrims can ascend the 693 steps to the sanctum or utilize the 'Yanai Pathai' (elephant path). Modern amenities, such as a rope car and winch system, have been introduced to facilitate access. The temple complex also houses shrines dedicated to other deities, including Lord Shiva, Goddess Parvati, and Siddhar Bhogar, reflecting the site's rich spiritual tapestry.</p>
