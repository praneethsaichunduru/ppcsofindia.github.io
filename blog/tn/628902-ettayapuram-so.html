		<p>Subramania Bharati, born on December 11, 1882, in Ettayapuram, Madras Presidency, emerged as a seminal figure in Tamil literature and the Indian independence movement. Born to Chinnaswami Subramania Iyer and Lakshmi Ammal, Bharati exhibited prodigious linguistic talents from an early age, mastering languages such as Sanskrit, English, Hindi, Telugu, French, and Arabic. His poetic prowess earned him the title "Bharati," signifying the blessings of the goddess Saraswati, bestowed upon him by the king of Ettayapuram when he was just 11 years old. At 15, he married Chellamma, and the couple had two children. Bharati pursued higher education at MDT Hindu College in Tirunelveli.</p>
		<p>Bharati's contributions to Tamil literature are monumental. He is often hailed as the father of modern Tamil poetry, introducing a new style that employed simple language and accessible rhythms, making his works resonate with the common populace. His poetry covered a vast array of themes, from devotion and nature to patriotism and social reform. Notable works include "Kuyil Pattu" (Song of the Cuckoo), "Panchali Sapatham" (Panchali's Vow), and "Kannan Pattu" (Songs to Krishna), all composed during his exile in Pondicherry. His writings not only enriched Tamil literature but also played a pivotal role in inspiring the masses during the struggle for independence.</p>
		<p>Beyond literature, Bharati was an ardent freedom fighter. His association with prominent leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Aurobindo Ghosh deepened his commitment to the nationalist cause. Through his involvement with publications such as the Tamil daily "Swadesamitran," the Tamil weekly "India," and the English newspaper "Bala Bharatham," he disseminated revolutionary ideas and fervently advocated for independence. His writings often challenged colonial rule and called for unity among Indians, transcending caste and religious barriers.</p>
		<p>Bharati's vision extended to social reforms, particularly concerning women's rights. He championed women's education, opposed child marriage, and advocated for gender equality, envisioning a society where women had equal opportunities and respect. His progressive views were ahead of his time, challenging the prevailing orthodox norms and inspiring future generations to continue the fight for social justice.</p>
		<p>In 1918, Bharati returned to British India and was promptly arrested for his seditious writings and activities. After his release, he continued his literary and journalistic endeavors, but his health deteriorated due to the hardships endured during his activism. In 1921, he was attacked by an elephant at the Parthasarathy Temple in Triplicane, Chennai, an incident that severely affected his health. He succumbed to his injuries on September 12, 1921, at the age of 38. Despite his relatively short life, Bharati's legacy as a poet, patriot, and social reformer remains influential, continuing to inspire and resonate in contemporary times.</p>
