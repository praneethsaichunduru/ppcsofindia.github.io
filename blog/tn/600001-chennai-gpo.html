		<p>The Chennai General Post Office (GPO), located on Rajaji Salai at Parry's Corner, stands as a testament to the city's rich colonial heritage. Designed by the British architect Robert Chisholm, the building was inaugurated on April 26, 1884, after a decade of construction that commenced in 1874. The project was completed at a cost of ₹6.8 lakh. The GPO was established to centralize and enhance postal services in the region, reflecting the administrative advancements of that era.</p>
		<p>Architecturally, the Chennai GPO is a magnificent example of the Indo-Saracenic style, a fusion of Indian and Gothic elements. The three-storied structure spans 352 feet in length and 162 feet in width, encompassing a floor area of approximately 55,000 square feet. Its most striking features are the 125-foot-tall twin towers that once boasted Kerala-style caps, which were unfortunately lost to a mid-20th-century storm. The building's design includes a high-ceilinged central hall, with the ground floor originally housing stores and service areas, the first floor designated for offices, and the second floor providing accommodation for officers.</p>
		<p>Over the years, the building has faced challenges, including a significant fire in October 2000 that caused extensive damage to about 15,000 square feet of its area. Following this, a major restoration project was undertaken, culminating in the reopening of the first two floors in November 2005. In 2011, a portion of the roof collapsed due to heavy monsoon rains, highlighting the ongoing need for maintenance of this historic structure.</p>
		<p>Recognizing its historical and architectural significance, the Department of Posts has initiated further restoration efforts. In November 2023, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) to restore the 150-year-old building. INTACH's expertise in renovating heritage structures is expected to play a crucial role in preserving the GPO's legacy for future generations.</p>
