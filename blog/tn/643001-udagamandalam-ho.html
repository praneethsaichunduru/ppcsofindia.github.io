		<p>The Toda hut is a distinctive form of dwelling built by the Toda tribe, an indigenous pastoral community residing in the Nilgiri Hills of Tamil Nadu, India. The Toda people are a Dravidian ethnic group who have lived in the Nilgiri region for centuries, maintaining a unique cultural identity. Their language, Toda, is a part of the Dravidian language family and is considered one of the lesser-spoken tribal languages in India. Despite outside influences, the Todas have retained many of their traditions, including their architecture, dress, and pastoral lifestyle. They primarily reside in small hamlets called "munds," which consist of a few Toda huts, temples, and cattle enclosures.</p>
		<p>The Toda hut is an arched, barrel-shaped structure made from bamboo and reeds, with a thatched roof that provides insulation against the cold climate of the Nilgiri Hills. The huts do not have windows and feature a small entrance, usually around three feet high, requiring individuals to bend while entering, a design believed to protect against wild animals and retain heat. These huts are built without nails, using only interwoven bamboo and cane frameworks, showcasing the tribe's traditional construction skills. Each hut is meticulously crafted and has religious and cultural significance, serving as a home and sometimes as a ceremonial space. The Toda temples, which resemble the huts but are more intricately designed, are used for sacred rituals and prayers.</p>
		<p>The Toda people are traditionally pastoralists who depend on buffalo herding for their livelihood. Their economy revolves around dairy products such as milk, butter, and ghee, which are considered sacred and are used in religious ceremonies. The buffaloes play a crucial role in their sustenance, and Toda men are primarily responsible for herding and milking them. In earlier times, they practiced a barter system, exchanging dairy products with neighboring communities, such as the Badagas and Kotas. Over time, many Toda people have diversified their income sources, engaging in tourism, handicrafts, and government employment while still maintaining their pastoral heritage.</p>
		<p>Toda attire is distinct, reflecting their cultural identity and climatic adaptation. Men and women traditionally wear a single unstitched garment, a handwoven shawl called "putkuli," which is draped over their shoulders. The shawl is usually white with striking red and black embroidery, a design unique to the Toda community. Women wear their putkuli in a manner similar to a sari, while men drape it like a toga. The embroidery patterns, known as "pukhoor," are geometric and symbolic, often depicting nature, animals, and religious motifs. Toda women are skilled artisans, creating these embroidered shawls, which have gained recognition as a valuable handicraft.</p>
		<p>Although the Todas have lived a relatively isolated existence, modernization and external influences have brought changes to their lifestyle. Some members of the community have taken up education and moved into mainstream professions, while others remain engaged in traditional dairy farming and handicrafts. Efforts have been made to preserve their cultural heritage, including government initiatives to protect their land and encourage Toda embroidery as a means of livelihood. Despite these changes, the Toda people continue to uphold their customs, and their unique huts remain an enduring symbol of their resilience and traditional way of life in the Nilgiri Hills.</p>
