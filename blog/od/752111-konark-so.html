		<p>The Sun Temple of Konark, located in Odisha, is a masterpiece of ancient Indian architecture and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Built in the 13th century by King Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga dynasty, the temple is dedicated to Surya, the Sun God. Designed in the form of a colossal chariot, the temple symbolizes the divine journey of Surya across the heavens. Historical accounts, including the Madala Panji (chronicle of the Jagannath Temple), mention that the temple took around 12 years to complete, with thousands of artisans contributing to its grandeur. Though the main sanctum (vimana) is now in ruins, the surviving structures, including the audience hall (jagamohana) and the intricately carved exterior, continue to showcase the temple’s architectural brilliance.</p>
		<p>The temple's walls are adorned with elaborate sculptures depicting scenes from daily life, celestial beings, animals, and mythological figures. Many carvings reflect the influence of Tantric traditions, highlighting the artistic and spiritual richness of the period. The structure was strategically designed to align with the sun’s movement, allowing sunlight to enter the temple at specific times of the day. Historical records suggest that the temple once had a massive magnet at its top, which was believed to have held the main idol of Surya in midair. Over time, due to natural calamities and invasions, the temple suffered significant damage, and by the 19th century, much of the original structure had collapsed.</p>
		<p>Despite its partial ruin, the Sun Temple remains an architectural wonder. The jagamohana, which still stands, showcases the temple’s intricate design, featuring ornate pillars and sculptures of dancers and musicians. European travelers and British officials documented the temple extensively in the 18th and 19th centuries, leading to restoration efforts in the 20th century. Today, the temple is not just a historical site but also an important cultural symbol, attracting thousands of visitors and scholars who admire its artistic and engineering excellence.</p>
		<p>One of the most fascinating features of the Sun Temple is its 12 intricately carved stone wheels, which represent the chariot of Surya. These wheels, each measuring about 9 feet in diameter, are not just decorative but also function as sundials. The precise carvings on the spokes allow them to indicate time accurately when sunlight casts shadows on them. The detailed craftsmanship of these wheels highlights the advanced knowledge of astronomy and engineering possessed by the temple’s builders. Even today, they remain a subject of admiration and study, reinforcing the Sun Temple’s status as an unparalleled architectural marvel.</p>
