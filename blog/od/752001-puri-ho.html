		<p>Puri Jagannath Temple, located in the eastern Indian state of Odisha, stands as one of the most revered Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Jagannath, believed to be an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. The temple's architecture is an exemplary showcase of Kalinga style, characterized by its towering spire (shikhara), intricately carved stone motifs, and a vast courtyard.</p>
		<p>Constructed on a raised platform and surrounded by a high fortified wall, the temple complex includes several structures such as the main sanctum (Garbhagriha), assembly hall (Jagamohana), and a kitchen (Rosaghara) where daily offerings (Mahaprasad) are prepared for the deity. No matter what time of the day it is, no matter where the sun is shining through in the sky, the temple doesn't have a shadow. The Mahaprasad is prepared in the Rosaghara kitchen by thousands of priests and 7 earthen pots are placed one above the other and the food is cooked over firewood and the food in the topmost pot gets cooked first followed by the rest.</p>
		<p>Beyond its architectural grandeur, Puri Jagannath Temple is shrouded in mysteries and legends. One of the most intriguing aspects is the Banajaga Yatra, a ritualistic journey undertaken to find sacred neem trees from which the idols of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra will be carved anew every 12 or 19 years, a process known as Nabakalebara. The exact location of these trees is believed to be divinely revealed to the priests through dreams.</p>
		<p>Temple flag (dhwaja) consistently flutters in the opposite direction of the prevailing airflow. The flag at the top of the Jagannath Temple flutters in an opposite to the direction in which the wind blows. 1800 years old tradition, a priest climbs atop the Shikhara of the Jagannath Temple every day in order to change the flag. The temple is as tall as a 45 story building. No protective gears are used for the same and it is performed with bare hands. The temple's spire rises dramatically above the central shrine, topped with a unique wheel called <b>Nilachakra</b> made of an alloy of eight metals. The most amazing fact is that any viewer who views the chakra from a height at any point in Puri always sees that the chakra faces towards itself.</p>
		<p>The temple is also famous for its Rath Yatra, or the Chariot Festival, where the idols of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra are taken out of the temple in massive chariots and pulled by thousands of devotees. This annual event draws millions of pilgrims from all corners of the country and beyond, showcasing the vibrant religious fervor and cultural heritage of Odisha.</p>
		<p>Rituals at the temple are meticulously followed according to ancient traditions. Only Hindus are allowed entry into the temple, and specific rituals are performed daily by a select group of priests who belong to certain Brahmin families traditionally associated with the temple's administration. The Mahaprasad, offered to the deity first and then distributed to devotees, holds immense significance, with specific rules governing its preparation and distribution.</p>
		<p>Puri Jagannath Temple's cultural significance extends beyond religious boundaries, encompassing art, literature, and music, making it a symbol of Odisha's rich cultural heritage. The temple's management is governed by elaborate rules and regulations laid down centuries ago, ensuring its sanctity and continuity.</p>
