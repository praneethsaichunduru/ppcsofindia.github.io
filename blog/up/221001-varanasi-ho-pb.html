		<p>The Kashi Vishwanath Temple, nestled on the western bank of the sacred Ganges River in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, stands as one of Hinduism's most revered shrines. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, who is venerated here as Vishveshwara or "Ruler of the Universe," the temple houses one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, which are considered the most sacred abodes of Shiva. The city's ancient name, Kashi, reflects its status as a luminous center of spirituality and learning. Hindus believe that dying in Kashi grants moksha, or liberation from the cycle of rebirth, making it a pivotal pilgrimage destination.</p>
		<p>The temple's history is a tapestry of resilience and devotion, marked by cycles of destruction and reconstruction. The original structure is believed to have been built in the 11th century by King Hari Chandra. However, it faced multiple demolitions, notably in 1194 CE by the forces of Qutb-ud-din Aibak and later under the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1669, who erected the Gyanvapi Mosque on its site. The current edifice owes its existence to Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore, who, in 1780, commissioned the temple's reconstruction after Lord Shiva appeared to her in a dream. Further embellishments were made in 1839 when Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Punjab donated approximately one ton of gold to gild the temple's domes, earning it the moniker "Golden Temple of Varanasi." Contributions from other dignitaries, such as the Bhosales of Nagpur, who donated silver for the temple, have also enhanced its grandeur.</p>
		<p>Architecturally, the Kashi Vishwanath Temple is a quadrangular structure encompassing various smaller shrines dedicated to deities like Vishnu, Vinayaka (Ganesha), and Kala Bhairava. The sanctum sanctorum houses the black stone Jyotirlinga, measuring about 60 cm in height and 90 cm in circumference, seated on a solid silver platform. Within the temple complex lies the Jnana Vapi or "Well of Wisdom." Legend narrates that during one of the temple's assaults, the chief priest concealed the Jyotirlinga within this well to protect it from desecration. Devotees access the temple through the bustling Kashi Vishwanath Gali, a narrow lane teeming with shops offering religious paraphernalia, traditional Banarasi sarees, and local delicacies like the famed Banarasi paan.</p>
		<p>The temple's spiritual significance is profound, with references found in ancient scriptures such as the Skanda Purana. It is believed that Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati chose Kashi as their abode after marriage, establishing it as a divine epicenter. The temple has attracted numerous saints and spiritual leaders over the centuries, including Adi Shankaracharya, Guru Nanak, and Swami Vivekananda, who have sought the blessings of Vishveshwara. The belief that Lord Shiva whispers the Taraka mantra into the ears of those who die within Kashi's precincts, ensuring their liberation, underscores the temple's sanctity.</p>
		<p>In recent times, the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project has transformed the temple's surroundings, enhancing connectivity between the temple and the ghats along the Ganges. This initiative has improved the pilgrim experience, allowing for smoother access and accommodating the influx of devotees, which can number in the millions during festivals like Maha Shivaratri and the auspicious month of Shravan. The temple's daily rituals commence as early as 2:30 AM, with the Mangala Aarti, and continue throughout the day, reflecting the unwavering devotion of its followers.</p>
