		<p>The Red Fort, or Lal Qila, stands as a monumental testament to India's rich history and architectural prowess. Commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1639, this iconic fortification was completed in 1648, marking a significant shift of the Mughal capital from Agra to Delhi. Designed by the renowned architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also conceptualized the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort exemplifies the zenith of Mughal architecture, blending Persian, Timurid, and indigenous Indian styles into a cohesive and majestic structure.</p>
    		<p>Constructed primarily from red sandstone, the fort's imposing walls stretch approximately 2.41 kilometers, with heights varying from 18 meters on the riverside to 33 meters on the city side. The fort's layout is an irregular octagon, encompassing an area of over 103 hectares. Within its confines lie a series of exquisite structures, including the Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience), where the emperor addressed the public, and the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), reserved for meetings with dignitaries. The Moti Masjid, a pristine white marble mosque added by Aurangzeb in 1663, further enhances the fort's architectural diversity. The fort's gardens, pavilions, and intricate marble inlays reflect a synthesis of Islamic, Persian, and Hindu design elements, showcasing the cultural amalgamation prevalent during the Mughal era.</p>
    		<p>Throughout its history, the Red Fort has been a silent witness to numerous pivotal events. In 1739, it endured the invasion of Nadir Shah, who plundered its treasures, including the famed Peacock Throne. The fort also bore the brunt of the 1857 Indian Rebellion against British rule, after which significant portions were destroyed or altered by the British colonialists. Despite these upheavals, the fort's resilient walls have stood firm, embodying the tumultuous yet rich tapestry of India's past.</p>
    		<p>Under British colonial rule, the Red Fort underwent a transformation from a symbol of Mughal sovereignty to a military bastion. The British demolished many of its internal structures to accommodate barracks and other military installations. The fort's strategic location made it a focal point for British administrative and military activities in Delhi. However, this period also saw neglect and deterioration of the fort's historic edifices, as colonial priorities overshadowed preservation efforts.</p>
    		<p>With India's hard-fought independence in 1947, the Red Fort reclaimed its stature as a symbol of national pride and resilience. On August 15, 1947, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru hoisted the Indian tricolor from the fort's Lahori Gate, marking the end of colonial rule. This tradition continues annually, with the Prime Minister addressing the nation from the same spot on Independence Day. In 2007, UNESCO recognized the Red Fort as a World Heritage Site, acknowledging its historical and cultural significance. Today, it stands not only as a reminder of India's imperial past but also as a beacon of its enduring spirit and sovereignty.</p>
