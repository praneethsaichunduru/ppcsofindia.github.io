		<p>The Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) is India’s premier training institute for civil services, located in Mussoorie, Uttarakhand. Established in 1959, it serves as the primary institution for training officers selected for the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and other Group-A Central Civil Services. The academy was set up following the recommendations of the Report on Public Administration by the Indian government, which emphasized the need for a structured training program for civil servants. Initially known as the National Academy of Administration, it was renamed in 1972 in honor of Lal Bahadur Shastri, India’s second Prime Minister. The location in Mussoorie was chosen for its climate and seclusion, providing an ideal environment for focused learning and disciplined training.</p>
		<p>LBSNAA primarily offers the Foundation Course, which is mandatory for all Group-A civil services officers before they proceed to their respective cadre training institutions. For IAS officers, the academy conducts the two-phase IAS Professional Course. Phase I focuses on administrative skills, governance, and policy-making, while Phase II, conducted after their district training, refines their practical knowledge. The academy also conducts Mid-Career Training Programs (MCTP) for officers at different stages of their careers. Special programs such as the Induction Training for officers promoted to the IAS, thematic workshops, and international collaborations for knowledge exchange are also part of the academy’s curriculum.</p>
		<p>The academy functions under the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), Government of India, and is guided by a Director, usually a senior IAS officer. It is an autonomous institution, though its policies and training modules are structured according to government guidelines. Over the years, LBSNAA has evolved into a hub for research and policy development, offering a platform for discussions on governance and administrative reforms. The faculty includes experienced bureaucrats, academic scholars, and guest lecturers from various fields, ensuring that the trainees receive a comprehensive understanding of public administration.</p>
		<p>Apart from academic training, LBSNAA emphasizes physical and outdoor activities, including trekking in the Himalayas, sports, and adventure exercises. These activities are designed to build resilience, teamwork, and leadership skills among trainees. The academy also houses the Sampoornanand Auditorium, a well-equipped library, and modern residential facilities. Its National Institute of Administrative Research (NIAR) undertakes policy research and documentation, contributing to administrative studies. Additionally, LBSNAA collaborates with global institutions, including the Harvard Kennedy School and the University of Cambridge, to integrate best practices from international governance models into its training programs.</p>
		<p>The academy’s alumni include some of India’s most influential bureaucrats, policymakers, and administrators who have played key roles in shaping the nation’s governance. It remains the nerve center of India’s civil services training, continuously adapting its curriculum to meet emerging administrative challenges. With its rigorous academic structure, emphasis on ethics and integrity, and holistic development approach, LBSNAA continues to serve as the cornerstone of India’s administrative framework, molding future leaders who uphold the principles of democracy and governance.</p>
