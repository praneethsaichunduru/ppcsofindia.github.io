		<p>The <b>Cellular Jail</b>, located in <b>Port Blair</b>, the capital of the <b>Andaman and Nicobar Islands</b>, is a historic colonial prison that stands as a grim reminder of India’s freedom struggle. Originally known simply as the <b>Cellular Jail</b>, it is now formally called the <b>Cellular Jail National Memorial</b>, a name it received in 1979 after being declared a national monument by the Government of India. The prison was constructed by the British colonial administration between <b>1896 and 1906</b>, primarily to isolate and punish Indian political prisoners who were involved in the freedom movement. Additionally, it served as a site for the British to subjugate the indigenous tribes of the Andaman Islands, who fiercely resisted foreign control.</p>
		<p>The idea behind the construction of the jail was twofold. Firstly, the British wanted to deal strictly with the growing unrest among Indian revolutionaries by sending them to a remote, harsh prison far from the Indian mainland. Secondly, the British saw the Andaman Islands as a penal colony to control the indigenous population and use their labor for developing colonial infrastructure. The penal settlement allowed the British to impose a cruel form of punishment that combined physical isolation, forced labor, and psychological trauma. The location also ensured prisoners were cut off from the rest of the world, often never to return.</p>
		<p>Architecturally, the Cellular Jail was modeled on the ‘<b>Panopticon</b>’ design proposed by English philosopher Jeremy Bentham, which allowed a single watchman to observe all prisoners without them being able to tell whether they were being watched. The jail originally had <b>seven wings</b> radiating from a central watchtower, resembling the spokes of a wheel. Each wing had three stories, and each of the <b>693 cells</b> was built for solitary confinement—there were no dormitories. Each cell measured about 13.5 feet by 7 feet and had a single ventilator at a height of 10 feet, making it impossible for prisoners to communicate with one another.</p>
		<p>Over the years, the jail housed several prominent Indian freedom fighters and revolutionaries. Among them were <b>Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Batukeshwar Dutt, Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi, and Yogendra Shukla</b>. The British authorities subjected prisoners to extreme cruelty—beatings, hard labor, food deprivation, and solitary confinement. Many were forced to manually operate oil mills under inhumane conditions, a task designed to break their spirit. Hunger strikes were common in protest of these tortures, the most notable being the one in <b>1933</b>, which drew national attention and eventually led to a few reforms.</p>
		<p>In addition to being a place of exile and punishment for revolutionaries, the Cellular Jail also played a significant role during <b>World War II</b>. The Japanese occupied the Andaman Islands from 1942 to 1945, during which time they used the jail for detaining British prisoners. After India gained independence in 1947, much of the original structure was destroyed or fell into disrepair, with only <b>three of the original seven wings</b> surviving today. The preserved parts have been turned into a museum, housing photographs, exhibits, and a sound-and-light show narrating the stories of the prisoners. Today, the <b>Cellular Jail National Memorial</b> stands as a solemn tribute to the resilience of Indian freedom fighters and a stark reminder of colonial oppression.</p>
