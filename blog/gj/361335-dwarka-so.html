		<p>The Dwarkadhish Temple, also known as the Jagat Mandir, is a significant Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Krishna, situated in Dwarka, Gujarat. It is believed to have been originally built by Vajranabh, the great-grandson of Krishna, over 2,500 years ago. Historical records suggest that the temple has undergone several reconstructions over the centuries. The present structure dates back to the 16th century, built under the patronage of the Gujarat Sultanate and later Hindu rulers. It stands as an important spiritual and historical landmark, deeply embedded in India's religious traditions.</p>
		<p>Dwarkadhish Temple holds immense importance in Hinduism, as Dwarka is considered the legendary kingdom of Lord Krishna. According to Hindu itihasas and puranas, Krishna migrated from Mathura to establish his kingdom in Dwarka, which is said to have been a magnificent city before it submerged into the Arabian Sea. Devotees believe that visiting this temple grants divine blessings, as it is considered one of the holiest pilgrimage sites associated with Krishna. The temple is an essential part of the Krishna Bhakti tradition, attracting millions of devotees annually, especially during Janmashtami, Krishna's birthday celebration.</p>
		<p>The temple holds a prestigious position in the <b>Char Dham</b> pilgrimage, one of the four most sacred sites in Hinduism, established by Adi Shankaracharya. Along with <b>Badrinath in the north, Rameswaram in the south, and Puri in the east,</b> Dwarkadhish Temple in the west completes this sacred circuit. Undertaking the Char Dham yatra is considered a path to salvation (moksha) in Hindu belief. Dwarka is also part of the <b>Sapta Puri</b>, the seven most ancient and sacred cities in India, further elevating its religious significance.</p>
		<p>Throughout history, the Dwarkadhish Temple has faced numerous invasions and destructions, particularly during the medieval period. It was first destroyed by Mahmud Begada in the 15th century and later suffered attacks during the Mughal era. However, each time it was rebuilt, demonstrating the unwavering devotion of Hindus towards Lord Krishna. The present structure, built in the 16th century, has undergone multiple restorations, with the latest conservation efforts supported by the Archaeological Survey of India to preserve its architectural grandeur and religious importance.</p>
		<p>The temple's deity, <b>Lord Krishna</b>, is revered in the form of Dwarkadhish, meaning "King of Dwarka." The main idol, a <b>black stone image of Krishna</b>, is about <b>2.25 feet tall</b> and is depicted in a regal pose with four arms, signifying his divine supremacy. Architecturally, the temple is a masterpiece of <b>Nagara-style</b> construction, featuring an elaborate five-story tower standing approximately <b>78 meters (256 feet) tall</b>. The temple is supported by <b>72 intricately carved pillars</b>, and its <b>Shikhara (spire)</b> is adorned with a massive 52-yard-long flag that is changed multiple times a day. The <b>Gomti River</b>, flowing near the temple, adds to the spiritual ambiance, making the Dwarkadhish Temple a revered site for pilgrims and tourists alike.</p>
