		<p><b><i>Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III</i></b> (born <b><i>Shivajirao Gaekwad</i></b>, 1863–1939) was one of the most visionary and reformist rulers of princely India. He ruled the state of <b><i>Baroda</i></b> (now part of Gujarat) from 1875 until 1939, following his adoption by Maharani Jamnabai after the death of Maharaja Khanderao Gaekwad. He was selected from a distant branch of the Gaekwad dynasty and educated at the <b><i>Rajkumar College, Rajkot</i></b>. At the age of 13, he ascended the throne under the regency of the British but was officially invested with full ruling powers in 1881. Sayajirao became one of the most progressive and enlightened monarchs of his time, committed to social, economic, and educational reform.</p>
		<p>One of Sayajirao's most enduring contributions was in the field of <b><i>education</i></b>. He introduced <b><i>free and compulsory primary education</i></b> in Baroda in 1906, a pioneering move in India at that time. He also established the <b><i>Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda</i></b> in 1949, named in his honor, though the groundwork was laid during his reign through the establishment of institutions like the <b><i>Baroda College</i></b> (now part of the university). He promoted education for women and lower castes, provided scholarships for higher studies abroad, and emphasized the importance of scientific and industrial research. Notably, he sponsored the education of <b><i>B.R. Ambedkar</i></b>, who would go on to become the architect of the Indian Constitution.</p>
		<p>Sayajirao was also a staunch advocate of <b><i>economic modernization</i></b>. Under his rule, Baroda saw significant development in infrastructure, including <b><i>railways, irrigation systems, and electric power</i></b>. He established a <b><i>State Bank of Baroda</i></b> in 1908 to promote economic growth and provide institutional financial support to farmers and entrepreneurs. His administration implemented land reforms and improved the revenue system to alleviate rural distress. Sayajirao encouraged indigenous industry and was known for his promotion of <b><i>swadeshi</i></b> (Indian-made goods), aligning with the broader nationalistic movements of the era.</p>
		<p>In social policy, Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad was far ahead of his time. He abolished <b><i>child marriage</i></b>, regulated <b><i>temple entry for lower castes</i></b>, and actively supported the eradication of <b><i>untouchability</i></b>. His emphasis on equal opportunity and justice made Baroda one of the most progressive states in India. He also supported the development of the arts, music, and literature, inviting artists from across India to Baroda. His patronage helped transform the city into a hub of cultural renaissance. The establishment of the <b><i>Baroda Museum and Picture Gallery</i></b> is a lasting testimony to his commitment to cultural preservation and public education.</p>
		<p>Sayajirao Gaekwad III had a complex but noteworthy relationship with the British Raj. While loyal to the British Crown, he was also known for his independent views and actions. At the <b><i>Delhi Durbar of 1911</i></b>, he famously broke protocol by not fully bowing to King George V, a gesture seen by many as a subtle assertion of Indian sovereignty. He was one of the few Indian princes who openly supported democratic principles and constitutional governance. Sayajirao’s reign of over six decades left a profound and progressive legacy, making Baroda a model princely state and him a revered figure in Indian history.</p>
