		<p>The Hidimba Devi Temple, also known as the Dhungari Temple, is a revered shrine nestled amidst cedar forests in Manali, Himachal Pradesh. Dedicated to Hidimba Devi, a prominent character from the <i>Mahabharata</i>, this ancient temple is a unique blend of mythology, traditional Himalayan architecture, and local faith. Built in 1553 CE by Maharaja Bahadur Singh of Kullu, the temple honors Hidimba, a rakshasi (demoness) who became the wife of Bhima, the second Pandava. Her penance and transformation from a forest-dwelling spirit to a goddess are central to her worship in this region.</p>
		<p>According to the <i>Mahabharata</i>, Hidimba and her brother Hidimb lived in the forests of the region now known as Manali. When the Pandavas were in exile, they visited these forests. Bhima, known for his strength, killed Hidimb in a fierce battle when he threatened to harm his family. After Hidimb’s death, Hidimba fell in love with Bhima and expressed her desire to marry him. With Kunti's approval, Bhima agreed to the union under the condition that he would leave her after a year. Their union bore a son, Ghatotkacha, who later played a significant role in the Kurukshetra war. After Bhima left, Hidimba is believed to have undertaken intense meditation and spiritual practice in the forests, earning her the status of a goddess.</p>
		<p>The Hidimba Devi Temple stands at the spot where she is believed to have meditated. The temple's architecture is strikingly different from the typical North Indian temples. Built in the pagoda style, the temple has a three-tiered, intricately carved wooden roof surmounted by a metal cone-shaped pinnacle. The wooden façade features carvings of animals, celestial beings, and stylized foliate patterns. Unlike other temples, there is no idol of the goddess; instead, a large stone represents Hidimba Devi. A 24-meter-tall wooden tower built over a cave is believed to be the actual site of her penance.</p>
		<p>Local folklore adds layers to the mystique of this temple. One tale speaks of Ghatotkacha’s immense devotion to his mother and how he would visit this place to seek her blessings. Another belief is that Hidimba Devi continues to protect the people of the Kullu Valley. During the annual Dussehra celebrations in Kullu, her idol is carried in a grand procession, symbolizing her status as a powerful local deity. Interestingly, while the festival celebrates the victory of Rama over Ravana across most of India, in Kullu, it also honors local deities like Hidimba Devi, reflecting the fusion of pan-Indian epics with regional traditions.</p>
		<p>The Hidimba Devi Temple is not only a place of worship but also a testament to the cultural syncretism of the Himalayas. Surrounded by tall deodar trees and imbued with an aura of tranquility, it attracts thousands of devotees and tourists alike. Women in particular seek her blessings for marital harmony and fertility. The temple’s blend of epic heritage, local beliefs, and architectural elegance makes it one of the most iconic spiritual landmarks in Himachal Pradesh.</p>
