			<h1><b>SPECIAL CANCELLATIONS</b></h1>
			
			<p>A Special Cancellation refers to a unique postmark that is issued to commemorate a special event or occasion. Special Cancellations are often used for significant events such as important dates, exhibitions, festivals, and anniversaries.</p>

			<p>These cancellations are designed to be visually appealing and may feature a special design or graphic that relates to the event being commemorated. In some cases, Special Cancellations may also include text or other elements that provide additional information about the event.</p>
	
			<p>Special Cancellations serve both a symbolic and functional purpose in the world of Philately, and are highly valued by collectors and stamp enthusiasts for their unique and interesting designs, as well as their historical and cultural significance.</p>
	
			<p>In general, these cancellations are issued only on a specific day, and cannot be used after that. On the day of issue, this cancellation can be applied as regular cancellation on postal stationery and stamps. Postal Circles of the states are responsible for issuing the Special Cancellations.</p>
